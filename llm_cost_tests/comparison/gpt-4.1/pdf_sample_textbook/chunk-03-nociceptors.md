# Nociceptors

Nociceptors have free nerve endings and are classified as high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors. These respond to mechanical damage, heat, and noxious chemicals, with signal magnitudes depending on tissue deformation. Pain signals are categorized into first pain (localized, rapid), second pain (burning, poorly localized), and third pain (deep, chronic, referred).
