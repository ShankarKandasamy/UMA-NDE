# Muscle Spindles

Muscle spindles are stretch receptors distributed throughout striated muscles, composed of intrafusal fibers and surrounded by a capsule. When the muscle stretches, the spindle's central region extends, triggering sensory activity. These spindles receive both alpha (extrafusal) and gamma (intrafusal) motor neuron innervation, which helps maintain spindle sensitivity across various muscle lengths.
