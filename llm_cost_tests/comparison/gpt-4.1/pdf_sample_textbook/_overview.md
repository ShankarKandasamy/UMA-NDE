## Summary

This document, extracted from a Wikibook chapter on sensory systems, provides a detailed overview of the anatomy and physiology of the somatosensory system, incorporating content and diagrams from authoritative academic sources. Subjects covered include types and functions of sensory receptors in the skin (cutaneous receptors), muscles (muscle spindles), and joints (joint receptors), as well as pain pathways and proprioceptive feedback. The document specifies the mechanisms, roles, locations, and types of mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors, along with their contributions to sensory input and motor activity. It includes labeled anatomical diagrams, a comprehensive table categorizing receptor properties, and an infographic summarizing feedback loops, making it useful for answering questions about sensory receptor function, proprioception, pain transmission, and somatosensory neuroanatomy.

### Properties of Skin Receptors

|  | Rapidly adapting | Slowly adapting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface receptor / small receptive field | Hair receptor, Meissner’s corpuscle: Detect an insect or a very fine vibration. Used for recognizing texture. | Merkel’s receptor: Used for spatial details, e.g. a round surface edge or “an X” in brail. |
| Deep receptor / large receptive field | Pacinian corpuscle: “A diffuse vibration” e.g. tapping with a pencil. | Ruffini’s corpuscle: “A skin stretch”. Used for joint position in fingers. |

- **Page 1:** Diagram showing cross-sections of human hairy and glabrous skin, labeling the various mechanoreceptors such as Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles, Merkel’s disks, hair and free nerve endings. It contextualizes the discussion on cutaneous receptors.
  - OCR: Figure 1: Receptors in the human skin: Mechanoreceptors can be free receptors or encapsulated. Examples for free receptors are the hair receptors at the roots of hairs. Encapsulated receptors are the Pacinian corpuscles and the receptors in the glabrous (hairless) skin: Meissner corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles and Merkel’s disks.

- **Page 2:** Three-part schematic illustrating the anatomy of a mammalian muscle spindle, its neuronal connections, and a close-up schematic, supporting the explanation of muscle spindles as stretch receptors.
  - OCR: Figure 2: Mammalian muscle spindle showing typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in spinal cord (middle) and expanded schematic (right). The spindle is a stretch receptor with its own motor supply consisting of several intrafusal muscle fibres. The sensory endings of a primary (group Ia) afferent and a secondary (group II) afferent coil around the non-contractile central portions of the intrafusal fibres.
- **Page 4:** A flowchart-style diagram visualizing neural feedback pathways for proprioceptive signals in limb movement, correlating with the text's explanation of force, length, and velocity feedback in neuromuscular control.
  - OCR: Figure 3: Feedback loops for proprioceptive signals for the perception and control of limb movements. Arrows indicate excitatory connections; filled circles inhibitory connections.

  - Insights: The diagram maps complex neural feedback involved in proprioceptive limb control. Force and length feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs interact with motor neurons and interneurons to regulate movement and maintain limb position against external loads.
