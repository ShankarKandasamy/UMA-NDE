  "summary": "This document, extracted from a Wikibook chapter on sensory systems, provides a detailed overview of the anatomy and physiology of the somatosensory system, incorporating content and diagrams from authoritative academic sources. Subjects covered include types and functions of sensory receptors in the skin (cutaneous receptors), muscles (muscle spindles), and joints (joint receptors), as well as pain pathways and proprioceptive feedback. The document specifies the mechanisms, roles, locations, and types of mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors, along with their contributions to sensory input and motor activity. It includes labeled anatomical diagrams, a comprehensive table categorizing receptor properties, and an infographic summarizing feedback loops, making it useful for answering questions about sensory receptor function, proprioception, pain transmission, and somatosensory neuroanatomy.",

      "text": "This is a sample document to showcase page-based formatting. It contains a chapter from a Wikibook called Sensory Systems. None of the content has been changed in this article, but some content has been removed. Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, called cutaneous receptors, inform us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and surface texture (mechanoreceptors), and pain (nociceptors). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles."

      "heading": "Cutaneous receptors",
      "text": "Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force during object manipulation. These receptors respond with brief bursts of action potentials when encountering small surface movements. Merkel’s receptors, which adapt slowly, are responsible for form and texture perception and are denser in the digits and around the mouth, but decrease in density with age. Pacinian corpuscles register vibration, while Ruffini corpuscles detect skin stretch. The distribution and depth of these receptors in hairy and glabrous skin is discussed."

    {
      "heading": "Nociceptors",
      "text": "Nociceptors have free nerve endings and are classified as high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors. These respond to mechanical damage, heat, and noxious chemicals, with signal magnitudes depending on tissue deformation. Pain signals are categorized into first pain (localized, rapid), second pain (burning, poorly localized), and third pain (deep, chronic, referred)."

    {
      "heading": "Muscle Spindles",
      "text": "Muscle spindles are stretch receptors distributed throughout striated muscles, composed of intrafusal fibers and surrounded by a capsule. When the muscle stretches, the spindle's central region extends, triggering sensory activity. These spindles receive both alpha (extrafusal) and gamma (intrafusal) motor neuron innervation, which helps maintain spindle sensitivity across various muscle lengths."

    {
      "heading": "Joint receptors",
      "text": "Joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors classified into four groups that monitor joint position, movement, direction, and speed. Type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors associated with pain signaling. The section summarizes their roles in proprioception."
