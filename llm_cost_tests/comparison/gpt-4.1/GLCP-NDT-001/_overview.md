## Summary

This is a technical procedure document issued by the Great Lakes Chemical Processing (GLCP) Hamilton Plant, titled 'Site-Specific NDE Requirements' (Document Number: GLCP-NDT-001, Revision 3, effective January 15, 2024). It sets forth mandatory protocols for Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) activities—including ultrasonic thickness measurement, magnetic particle testing, liquid penetrant testing, visual inspection, and radiographic testing—on pressure-containing equipment and piping systems. The document details qualifications required for NDE personnel, equipment and calibration standards, data collection and reporting procedures, acceptance thresholds, safety (including H2S monitoring and PPE), permit requirements, and incident notification protocols. It references API and ASME codes, as well as site-specific safety and work permit protocols. This document would help answer queries on site-specific NDE compliance, required certifications and equipment, inspection documentation, acceptance/rejection criteria, and related site procedures and safety requirements.
