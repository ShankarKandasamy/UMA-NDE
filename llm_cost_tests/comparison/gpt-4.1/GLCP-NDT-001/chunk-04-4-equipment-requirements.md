# 4. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1 Ultrasonic Thickness Gauges
All UT thickness gauges shall meet the following minimum requirements: • Digital display with minimum resolution of 0.001 inch • Data logging capability with minimum 1000 reading storage • Capable of operating in temperature range 32°F to 120°F • Battery life sufficient for full shift operation (minimum 8 hours) • Dual or multi-element transducer capability for high-temperature applications
4.2 Calibration Requirements
All measurement equipment shall have current calibration traceable to NIST or equivalent national standards body. Calibration certificates shall be provided showing calibration date, due date, and standards used.
Equipment Type Calibration Interval Verification Frequency
UT Thickness Gauge 12 months Daily (before use)
UT Transducers 12 months Daily (with gauge)
Calibration Blocks 24 months N/A
Yoke/Prod (MT) 12 months Before each use
4.3 Daily Calibration Verification
UT thickness gauges shall be verified at the start of each work shift using a multi-step calibration block. Verification shall be performed on steps bracketing the expected measurement range. Acceptable deviation is ±0.002 inch. Verification shall be documented with date, time, operator, and readings.
