# Equipment Requirements

Ultrasonic Thickness Gauges: Digital display (min. 0.001 inch resolution), data logging (1000 minimum readings), 32°F-120°F range, 8-hour battery life, dual/multi-transducer capability for high temps.
Calibration: All equipment must have current calibration traceable to NIST/equivalent. Certificates show calibration date, due date, standards used.
Calibration Intervals/Verification:
- UT Gauge: 12 months, verified daily
- UT Transducers: 12 months, verified daily
- Calibration Blocks: 24 months
- MT Yoke/Prod: 12 months, before each use
Daily UT gauge verification with a multi-step calibration block bracketing expected range. Acceptable deviation ±0.002 inch, documented with date, time, operator, and readings.
