# Nociceptors

Nociceptors have free nerve endings. Functionally, skin nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors. They respond to intense mechanical stimuli, heat, and noxious chemicals. Pain signals can be categorized into first, second, and third pain, based on their transmission speed and localization.
