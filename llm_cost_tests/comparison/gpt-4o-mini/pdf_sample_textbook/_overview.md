## Summary

This document is a chapter from a Wikibook detailing the anatomy and functions of the somatosensory system. It covers the different types of sensory receptors (cutaneous, nociceptors, muscle spindles, and joint receptors) and their roles in perceiving stimuli such as temperature, pressure, pain, and body position. Key subjects include mechanoreceptors, muscle spindle functions, and the distinction between rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. The content contains descriptive diagrams and tables illustrating receptor functions and properties. It answers questions regarding how different receptors contribute to sensory perception and motor activities.

### Surface vs Deep Receptors

| Type | Example | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rapidly adapting | Hair receptor, Meissner’s corpuscle | Detect an insect or fine vibration; recognize texture. |
| Slowly adapting | Merkel’s receptor | Used for spatial details, e.g., a round surface edge. |
| Deep receptor | Pacinian corpuscle | Detect 'diffuse vibration'. |
| Deep receptor | Ruffini’s corpuscle | Detect 'skin stretch' and used for joint position. |
