# Cutaneous receptors

Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief burst of action potentials when objects move a small distance during the early stages of lifting. The slowly adapting Merkel’s receptors are responsible for form and texture perception, while rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles give a feeling of vibration.
