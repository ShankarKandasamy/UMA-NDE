  "summary": "This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) document (GLCP-RFQ-2024-089) issued by Great Lakes Chemical Processing (GLCP), Hamilton, ON, dated October 15, 2024, with responses due October 22, 2024. It solicits quotations from qualified NDE contractors to perform ultrasonic thickness (UT) survey services on 18 piping systems (150 CML locations) within the Amine Treating Unit (ATU-100) at the Hamilton Plant, as part of their API 570 mechanical integrity program. The document specifies technical requirements including applicable codes (API 570, API 574, ASME B31.3, ASME Section V Article 5), equipment specs (0.001\" resolution digital UT gauges with NIST-traceable calibration), and personnel qualifications (ASNT SNT-TC-1A UT Level II minimum, 5 years experience for lead). It includes a detailed schedule with field work November 4-7, 2024, deliverables list, safety requirements, proposal requirements, and Attachment A with the full piping line list showing line numbers, services, sizes, materials, and CML counts. Key services include Rich Amine, Lean Amine, Sour Gas, Reflux, and Treated Gas lines in A106 Gr.B and 316SS materials.",
