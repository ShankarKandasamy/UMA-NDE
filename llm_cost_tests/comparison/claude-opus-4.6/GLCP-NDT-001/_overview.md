## Summary

This is a site-specific Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) requirements document (GLCP-NDT-001, Rev 3, effective Jan 15, 2024) for the Great Lakes Chemical Processing Hamilton Plant. It governs all NDE contractor activities including UT, MT, PT, VT, and RT on pressure-containing equipment and piping. Key contents: personnel qualification requirements per ASNT SNT-TC-1A/CP-189 with minimum certification levels and experience for each NDE activity; equipment specifications for UT thickness gauges (resolution, data logging, temperature range); calibration intervals and daily verification procedures (±0.002 inch tolerance); UT measurement procedures including surface prep, couplant, minimum 4 readings per CML at 90° spacing; material velocity settings for carbon steel, stainless steel, duplex, chrome-moly, and aluminum; acceptance criteria with four alert thresholds (CRITICAL, Alert, Monitor, Acceptable) based on t-min values; notification procedures for critical findings including contact info for Inspection Coordinator Jennifer Walsh; documentation requirements mandating electronic data logging and photographic evidence; safety requirements including H2S monitoring (10/15 ppm alarms), PPE, and work permits. References API 570, 574, 510, ASME B31.3, ASME Section V.
