## Summary

This document is an educational article from a Wikibook called Sensory Systems, covering the anatomy of the somatosensory system. It describes cutaneous receptors (thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors), their types (Meissner corpuscles, Merkel's receptors, Pacinian corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles), and their roles in detecting temperature, pressure, texture, pain, and vibration. It details receptor density (e.g., 50/mm² in digits), adaptation properties (rapidly vs slowly adapting), and pain signal components (first/cutaneous pricking pain, second/burning pain, third/deep pain). The document also covers muscle spindles (intrafusal vs extrafusal fibers, alpha and gamma motor neurons), joint receptors (four groups signaling position, movement, direction, speed), and proprioceptive feedback loops. Includes a table classifying receptors by adaptation speed and depth, a diagram of skin receptor anatomy, a muscle spindle schematic, and a feedback loop diagram for limb movement control. Based on lecture notes from Laszlo Zaborszky, Rutgers University.

### Table 1: Classification of cutaneous receptors by adaptation speed and receptive field

|  | Rapidly adapting | Slowly adapting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface receptor / small receptive field | Hair receptor, Meissner's corpuscle: Detect an insect or a very fine vibration. Used for recognizing texture. | Merkel's receptor: Used for spatial details, e.g. a round surface edge or "an X" in brail. |
| Deep receptor / large receptive field | Pacinian corpuscle: "A diffuse vibration" e.g. tapping with a pencil. | Ruffini's corpuscle: "A skin stretch". Used for joint position in fingers. |

- **Page 1:** Cross-sectional diagram of human skin showing the locations of various mechanoreceptors. The left side shows hairy skin with hair receptors, sebaceous glands, and Pacinian corpuscles in the dermis. The right side shows glabrous (hairless) skin with Meissner's corpuscles near the papillary ridges in the epidermis, Merkel's receptors, Ruffini's corpuscles in the dermis, and free nerve endings.

- **Page 2:** Diagram of a mammalian muscle spindle showing three views: typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in the spinal cord (middle), and an expanded schematic (right). The schematic shows intrafusal muscle fibers within a capsule, with primary (group Ia) and secondary (group II) afferent sensory endings coiling around the non-contractile central portions, and gamma motoneuron innervation.

  - Insights: The diagram shows a control system for limb movement with two main feedback loops: (1) Force feedback via Golgi tendon organs through interneurons, and (2) Length and velocity feedback via muscle spindles with gamma bias. The system includes force control signals and driving signals feeding through alpha motor neurons to muscle, then through tendon organs measuring muscle force, with external forces and load affecting muscle length. Arrows indicate excitatory connections and filled circles indicate inhibitory connections.
