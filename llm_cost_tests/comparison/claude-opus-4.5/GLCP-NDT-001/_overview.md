## Summary

This is a site-specific Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) requirements document for Great Lakes Chemical Processing Hamilton Plant (Document GLCP-NDT-001, Rev 3, effective January 15, 2024). It establishes requirements for NDE contractors performing UT, MT, PT, VT, and RT on pressure-containing equipment and piping. Key content includes: personnel qualification requirements per ASNT SNT-TC-1A with minimum experience levels by activity type; equipment specifications for UT thickness gauges including calibration intervals; detailed UT measurement procedures with material velocity settings for various steels; acceptance criteria with alert thresholds (CRITICAL, Alert, Monitor, Acceptable); notification procedures for critical findings including contact info for Jennifer Walsh; documentation requirements for data recording and photography; safety requirements including permits, H2S monitoring, and PPE. References API 570, API 574, API 510, ASME B31.3, and ASME Section V. Useful for answering questions about NDE contractor requirements, calibration intervals, thickness measurement procedures, personnel qualifications, and safety protocols at this facility.
