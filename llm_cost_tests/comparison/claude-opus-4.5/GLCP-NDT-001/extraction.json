For elevated temperature surfaces (above 150°F), high-temperature couplant rated for the service temperature shall be used. Couplant shall be removed after measurement to prevent interference with coatings or corrosion protection systems.\n\n5.3 Measurement Technique: A minimum of four (4) readings shall be taken at each CML location, spaced approximately 90° apart around the circumference. The minimum reading shall be recorded as the official measurement. For suspected localized corrosion, additional readings in a grid pattern may be required."
