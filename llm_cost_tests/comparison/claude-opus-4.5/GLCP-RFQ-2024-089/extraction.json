  "pages": 5,
  "summary": "This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) document GLCP-RFQ-2024-089 issued by Great Lakes Chemical Processing (GLCP) on October 15, 2024, soliciting bids from qualified NDE contractors for ultrasonic thickness survey services on piping systems within the Amine Treating Unit (ATU-100) at their Hamilton, ON facility. The scope covers 18 piping lines with 150 total Condition Monitoring Locations (CMLs), with field work estimated at 4 days (November 4-7, 2024). Work must comply with API 570, API 574, ASME B31.3, and ASME Section V standards. Personnel must be ASNT SNT-TC-1A qualified UT Level II minimum. The document details technical requirements including 0.001\" resolution digital UT gauges, deliverables schedule, safety requirements, and proposal submission requirements. It includes a detailed piping line list showing services (Rich Amine, Lean Amine, Sour Gas, Treated Gas, etc.), sizes (2\"-8\"), and materials (primarily A106 Gr.B carbon steel, some 316SS). Useful for answering questions about NDE contractor qualifications, inspection scope, schedule, compliance standards, and piping specifications.",
