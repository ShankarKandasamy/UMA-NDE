## Summary

This is the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's Farm Financial Health Report for 2023-2024, analyzing the financial challenges facing Canadian farmers amid rising production costs and climate change. The document details how primary agriculture contributed $36.3 billion (1.8%) to Canada's GDP and supported 249,900 jobs. Key data includes: farm cash receipts increased 14.6% over 2021 but net income fell 5.9% in 2022 to $11.8 billion due to 18.6% increase in expenses. Fertilizer costs rose 54.4%, fuel expenses 52.5%, and commercial feed 20.7%. Farmland values increased 10% annually over 10 years, with Ontario land rising from $11,786 to $17,962 per acre (2019-2022). Contains 18 policy recommendations across four categories: managing production costs, improving risk management programs, promoting sustainable growth, and supporting young farmers. Includes regional Farm Input Price Index comparisons, wage and unemployment data, and commodity-specific analysis for pork and fruit/vegetable sectors.

- **line chart** (Page 7): Figure 1: Total Farm Input Price Index
  - Insights: All farm input costs have risen dramatically since 2020, with fertilizer showing the highest increase reaching index values around 160 (2012=100). Machinery fuel showed the most volatility, dropping in 2020 before rising sharply. The overall farm input total index rose from approximately 90 in early 2020 to around 150 by 2023.

- **bar chart** (Page 8): Figure 3: Farm Land Value ($/Acre)
  - Insights: Ontario has the highest farmland values by far, increasing from $11,786 per acre in 2019 to $17,962 in 2022. All provinces showed significant increases from 2020 to 2022, with Ontario experiencing the most dramatic rise. Quebec and British Columbia follow as second and third highest values.
