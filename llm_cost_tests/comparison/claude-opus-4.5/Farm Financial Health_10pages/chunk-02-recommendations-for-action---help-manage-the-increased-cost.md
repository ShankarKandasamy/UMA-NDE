# Recommendations for Action - Help manage the increased cost of production

Recommendation #1: Extend the on-farm carbon pricing exemption for qualifying farming fuel to marketable natural gas and propane.

Recommendation #2: Consult on and develop a Critical Farm Input Strategy to ensure that Canadian producers have a long-term, stable source of supply for critical farm inputs, including fertilizer, needed to produce high quality agriculture and agri-food products.

Recommendation #3: Make the interest-free limit for advances under the Advance Payments Program (APP) permanent beyond the 2023 program, alongside other administrative program adjustments, to make the APP more accessible and responsive to higher production costs.

Recommendation #4: Make Accelerated Capital Cost Allowance permanent across all classes of farm equipment, allowing producers to depreciate 100% of their capital allocated to purchases of farm equipment in the first year.
