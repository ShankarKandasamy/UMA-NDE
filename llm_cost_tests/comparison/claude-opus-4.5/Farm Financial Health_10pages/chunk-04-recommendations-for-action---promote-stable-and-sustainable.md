# Recommendations for Action - Promote stable and sustainable growth

Recommendation #13: Ensure the launch of the Sustainable Agriculture Strategy is inclusive of all agricultural commodities and is accompanied with an ambitious funding envelope commensurate with the incentives, research, and knowledge transfer activities required to address the inter-related demands of environmental, economic and social sustainability.

Recommendation #14: Strengthen Canada's international presence in advocating for the elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade in international trade agreements which are limiting market access for Canadian products.

Recommendation #15: Underpinned by supporting legislation, ensure no additional access to supply-managed sectors in future trade agreements to support a resilient domestic agricultural sector that is vital to national food security and long-term sustainable growth.
