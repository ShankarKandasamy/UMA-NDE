## Summary

This document is an educational chapter from the Wikibook 'Sensory Systems' covering the anatomy of the somatosensory system. It describes sensors in skin, muscles, tendons, and joints including cutaneous receptors (thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors). Key topics include: Meissner corpuscles and grip force adjustment, Merkel's receptors for form/texture perception with density data (50/mm² declining to 10/mm² by age 50), Pacinian corpuscles for vibration sensing, Ruffini corpuscles for skin stretch detection, nociceptors responding to mechanical stimuli, heat (40-60°C), and chemicals. Pain signal types are classified as first pain (cutaneous pricking), second pain (burning), and deep pain. Muscle spindles are explained with intrafusal/extrafusal fiber structure, alpha and gamma motor neurons. Joint receptors are categorized into four groups signaling position, movements, direction and speed. Contains receptor classification table, anatomical diagrams of skin receptors, muscle spindle structure, and proprioceptive feedback loops. Based on Laszlo Zaborszky's lecture notes from Rutgers University.

### Receptor Classification by Adaptation Rate and Location

| Receptor Type | Rapidly adapting | Slowly adapting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Surface receptor / small receptive field | Hair receptor, Meissner's corpuscle: Detect an insect or a very fine vibration. Used for recognizing texture. | Merkel's receptor: Used for spatial details, e.g. a round surface edge or "an X" in brail. |
| Deep receptor / large receptive field | Pacinian corpuscle: "A diffuse vibration" e.g. tapping with a pencil. | Ruffini's corpuscle: "A skin stretch". Used for joint position in fingers. |

Illustrates the difference between hairy skin and glabrous (hairless) skin, depicting various mechanoreceptors including Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner's corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles, Merkel's disks, hair receptors, and free nerve endings located in the epidermis and dermis layers.

- **Page 2:** Figure 2: Diagram of mammalian muscle spindle showing typical position in a muscle (left), neuronal connections in spinal cord (middle) and expanded schematic (right). The spindle is a stretch receptor with its own motor supply consisting of several intrafusal muscle fibres. The sensory endings of a primary (group Ia) afferent and a secondary (group II) afferent coil around the non-contractile central portions of the intrafusal fibres.

  - Insights: Diagram illustrates the proprioceptive feedback system with two main loops: force feedback via Golgi tendon organs and length/velocity feedback via muscle spindles. Arrows indicate excitatory connections while filled circles indicate inhibitory connections. Shows how alpha motor neurons control muscle contraction while gamma neurons regulate spindle sensitivity. External forces and load affect muscle length which is monitored by spindles feeding back to the control system.
