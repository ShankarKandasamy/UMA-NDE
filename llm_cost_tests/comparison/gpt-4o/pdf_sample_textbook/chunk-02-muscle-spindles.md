# Muscle Spindles

Muscle spindles are stretch receptors within muscle fibers, consisting of intrafusal fibers and sensory endings. These receptors are crucial for motor control, allowing adjustment of muscle sensitivity. They provide feedback on muscle length and help in proprioception. Muscle spindles receive both sensory and motor innervation, aiding in maintaining sensitivity across muscle lengths. Gamma motor neurons regulate spindle sensitivity.
