# Joint Receptors

Joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors divided into four groups, signaling joint characteristics like position and movement. These receptors include free receptors or type 4 joint receptors, serving as nociceptors. They play a role in signaling different aspects of joint function such as speed and direction of movement.
