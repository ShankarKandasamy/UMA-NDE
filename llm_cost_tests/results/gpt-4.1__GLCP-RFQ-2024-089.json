    "pages": 5,
    "summary": "This document is an official Request for Quotation (RFQ) issued by Great Lakes Chemical Processing (GLCP) for ultrasonic thickness (UT) survey services on piping systems within the Amine Treating Unit (ATU-100) at their Hamilton, ON facility. It targets qualified Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) contractors, detailing the scope of work, deliverables, technical and safety requirements, schedule, personnel qualifications, and proposal submission criteria in alignment with API and ASME standards. The document includes quantitative data, such as the number of piping lines and CMLs, detailed schedules, and required deliverables, along with a comprehensive piping line list (materials, services, sizes, and Condition Monitoring Locations). It could answer questions on bid process, UT survey requirements, applicable standards, schedule milestones, required documentation, safety protocols, and specifics about the piping systems and their inspection sites.",
