    "summary": "This is the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's Farm Financial Health Report for 2023-2024, analyzing the financial challenges facing Canadian farmers amid rising production costs and climate change. The document details how primary agriculture contributed $36.3 billion (1.8%) to Canada's GDP and supported 249,900 jobs. Key data includes: farm cash receipts increased 14.6% over 2021 but net income fell 5.9% in 2022 to $11.8 billion due to 18.6% increase in expenses. Fertilizer costs rose 54.4%, fuel expenses 52.5%, and commercial feed 20.7%. Farmland values increased 10% annually over 10 years, with Ontario land rising from $11,786 to $17,962 per acre (2019-2022). Contains 18 policy recommendations across four categories: managing production costs, improving risk management programs, promoting sustainable growth, and supporting young farmers. Includes regional Farm Input Price Index comparisons, wage and unemployment data, and commodity-specific analysis for pork and fruit/vegetable sectors.",

        "text": "Taking Stock of Farm Financial Health Amid Rising Costs of Production and a Rapidly Changing Climate\n\nFarmers across Canada have demonstrated tremendous resilience in the face of several domestic and global events including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and extreme climate events at home and abroad. In 2022, primary agriculture contributed $36.3 billion (1.8%) of Canada's GDP and supported 249,900 jobs across the country.\n\nHowever, through this time, the cost of critical farm inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, feed, machinery, pesticides, land and labour increased dramatically. When coupled with high inflation, interest rates and a price on carbon for essential farming activities, for which farmers have no viable alternatives, Canadian producers are facing tremendous pressure on their farm financial and mental health.\n\nWhile most Canadian farmers have managed to stay afloat, largely due to high commodity prices and farm cash receipts that increased 14.6% over 2021 levels, the ongoing impact of high inflation, matched with increasing interest rates, is beginning to take a serious toll on the operating margins of Canadian producers. Recent numbers from Statistics Canada have shown that the net income for Canadian farmers fell 5.9% in 2022, because the growth in expenses outpaced the rise in farm income; and total farm operating expenses (after rebates) increased by 19.9% in 2022, the largest gain since 1979 (+21.1%).\n\nMeanwhile, while the full weight of the Bank of Canada's string of interest rate hikes has yet to sink in, farmers across Canada are experiencing an increasing series of extreme weather events that are testing the limits and effectiveness of Canada's suite of risk management programs.\n\nTo help address many of these challenges, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) has put forward recommendations in several areas aimed at not only helping farmers manage the increasing cost of production and navigate challenging regulatory barriers, but also to help them mitigate the effects of climate change and support the next generation of farmers.\n\nCanadian farmers play a crucial role in sustaining our rural communities, as stewards of our natural environment and in meeting our national and international food security needs. The following recommendations are aimed at ensuring Canada's farmers have the flexibility and tools they need to weather the current financial climate and support the transition to a low emissions economy."

An immediate example would be using Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Drought Monitor to trigger an AgriRecovery assessment.\n\nRecommendation #7: Increase AgriStability program coverage to 85% of the reference margin to improve participation, predictability, and levels of support for producers.\n\nRecommendation #8: Ensure that the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) is appropriately resourced and improves internal processes in support of timely, transparent, and science-based decisions that will help Canadian producers remain competitive in a global market.\n\nRecommendation #9: Exempt farms from filing the Underused Housing Tax (UHT) return which requires private corporations and partnerships (including farms) that own residential property to file a UHT return, adding an unnecessary financial burden, even if they do not have to pay the tax.\n\nRecommendation #10: Implement measures to support a farmer's right to repair their farm machinery.\n\nRecommendation #11: Build on the Budget 2023 extended interswitching pilot by further expanding the distance beyond 160km and extending the pilot past the current 18-month period.\n\nRecommendation #12: Provide financial support for the creation of a Grocery Code Adjudication Office, which will be critical to advance the training, education, dispute resolution services, and oversight necessary to implement an industry-led Grocery Industry Code of Conduct."

        "text": "In 2022, Canadian farmers saw their total farm cash receipts increase by 14.6% compared to 2021, because of higher prices for both crops (+$7.1 billion) and livestock (+$3.6 billion) (Statistics Canada, 2023). However, this increase is overshadowed by a 18.6% increase in total expenses, pushing realized net income lower to $11.8 billion in 2022 from $12.8 billion, a 5.9% decrease from 2021 levels (Statistics Canada, 2023).\n\nOne of the most significant input costs for Canadian producers through 2021 and 2022 was fertilizer. According to Statistics Canada, fertilizer prices began rising rapidly in early 2021 due predominantly to high natural gas prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a 54.4% increase in 2022 (Statistics Canada, 2023).\n\nIn addition, successive droughts in Western Canada, beginning in 2021, limited the supply of hay and grain feed contributing to a 20.7% increase in commercial feed expenses for livestock producers. Further, fuel expenses increased by 52.5% in 2022 as demand increased with economies opening post-COVID-19 and supply decreased because of sanctions on large fuel exporters such as Russia."

The most prominent increase in land value were observed in Ontario, where the average value skyrocketed from $11,786 per acre in 2019 to $17,962 per acre in 2022 (Statistics Canada, 2023).\n\nAccording to Farm Credit Canada (FCC), Canadian farmland values have increased on average 10% annually over the last 10 years. In 2022, values rose 12.8%, the highest jump since 2013 (FCC, 2023). In addition, average annual mortgage payments increased 9.7% per year in the last decade, but 2022 recorded the large jump of 41% due to rising interest rates (FCC, 2023)."

        "heading": "Production costs are impacting sectors and regions differently across Canada",
        "text": "While expenses increased to record levels throughout Canada in 2022 (21.2% increase), the Farm Input Price Index (FIPI) revealed distinct regional variations. The FIPI is a measure of change in input costs faced by Canadian farmers and provides insights into the financial pressures on agricultural operations. For example, Western Canada (MB, SK, AB, BC) experienced a slightly higher increase in total farm input price rises from Q1 2019 to Q4 2022 (38%) vs. Eastern Canada (NL, PEI, NS, NB, QC, ON) (34%). Furthermore, while the cost of fuel was higher in Eastern Canada (72% vs 43%), Western Canada experienced higher feed prices (63% vs 49%).\n\nEven within the agriculture sector, certain commodities are being disproportionately impacted by financial pressures. For example, Canada's fruit and vegetable sector reported a 40% increase in input costs with fertilizer leading the way (72% increase since 2020).\n\nLabour costs have also increased by 20% and shipping by 42%. As a result, as of January 2023, 44% of fruit and vegetable producers reported that they were selling at a loss (Farmers Forum). In addition, Canada's pork industry is constrained by decreasing processor capacity and increasing non-tariff barriers to trade which means many producers are currently absorbing losses of $40 to $50 a head (RealAgriculture)."
