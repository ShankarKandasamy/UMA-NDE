It describes cutaneous receptors (thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors), their types (Meissner corpuscles, Merkel's receptors, Pacinian corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles), and their roles in detecting temperature, pressure, texture, pain, and vibration. It details receptor density (e.g., 50/mm\u00b2 in digits), adaptation properties (rapidly vs slowly adapting), and pain signal components (first/cutaneous pricking pain, second/burning pain, third/deep pain). The document also covers muscle spindles (intrafusal vs extrafusal fibers, alpha and gamma motor neurons), joint receptors (four groups signaling position, movement, direction, speed), and proprioceptive feedback loops. Includes a table classifying receptors by adaptation speed and depth, a diagram of skin receptor anatomy, a muscle spindle schematic, and a feedback loop diagram for limb movement control. Based on lecture notes from Laszlo Zaborszky, Rutgers University.",

          "text": "Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and surface texture (mechano receptors), and pain (nociceptors). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles."

          "heading": "Cutaneous receptors",
          "text": "Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief burst of action potentials when objects move a small distance during the early stages of lifting. In response to rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor activity.\n\nThe slowly adapting Merkel's receptors are responsible for form and texture perception. As would be expected for receptors mediating form perception, Merkel's receptors are present at high density in the digits and around the mouth (50/mm\u00b2 of skin surface), at lower density in other glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin. This innervations density shrinks progressively with the passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in human digits is reduced to 10/mm\u00b2. Unlike rapidly adapting axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the initial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation up to several seconds in duration.\n\nActivation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles gives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting Ruffini corpuscles respond to the lataral movement or stretching of skin."

          "heading": "Nociceptors",
          "text": "Nociceptors have free nerve endings. Functionally, skin nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors. Polymodal receptors respond not only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They also respond to temperatures in the range of 40\u201360\u00b0C, and change their response rates as a linear function of warming (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).\n\nPain signals can be separated into individual components, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called second pain or burning pain; it is poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated with referred pain."

These fibers are called intrafusal fibers, in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has few myofilaments and is non-contractile, but it does have one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the muscle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses.\n\nMuscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers are called alpha motor neurons, while the smaller ones supplying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are called gamma neurons. Gamma motor neurons can regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length."

It describes sensors in skin, muscles, tendons, and joints including cutaneous receptors (thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors). Key topics include: Meissner corpuscles and grip force adjustment, Merkel's receptors for form/texture perception with density data (50/mm\u00b2 declining to 10/mm\u00b2 by age 50), Pacinian corpuscles for vibration sensing, Ruffini corpuscles for skin stretch detection, nociceptors responding to mechanical stimuli, heat (40-60\u00b0C), and chemicals. Pain signal types are classified as first pain (cutaneous pricking), second pain (burning), and deep pain. Muscle spindles are explained with intrafusal/extrafusal fiber structure, alpha and gamma motor neurons. Joint receptors are categorized into four groups signaling position, movements, direction and speed. Contains receptor classification table, anatomical diagrams of skin receptors, muscle spindle structure, and proprioceptive feedback loops. Based on Laszlo Zaborszky's lecture notes from Rutgers University.",

          "text": "Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and surface texture (mechano receptors), and pain (nociceptors). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles."

          "text": "Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when objects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief burst of action potentials when objects move a small distance during the early stages of lifting. In response to rapidly adapting afferent activity, muscle force increases reflexively until the gripped object no longer moves. Such a rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication of the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor activity.\n\nThe slowly adapting Merkel's receptors are responsible for form and texture perception. As would be expected for receptors mediating form perception, Merkel's receptors are present at high density in the digits and around the mouth (50/mm\u00b2 of skin surface), at lower density in other glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin. This innervations density shrinks progressively with the passage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in human digits is reduced to 10/mm\u00b2. Unlike rapidly adapting axons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the initial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation up to several seconds in duration.\n\nActivation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles gives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting Ruffini corpuscles respond to the lateral movement or stretching of skin."

          "heading": "Nociceptors",
          "text": "Nociceptors have free nerve endings. Functionally, skin nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors. Polymodal receptors respond not only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and to noxious chemicals. These receptors respond to minute punctures of the epithelium, with a response magnitude that depends on the degree of tissue deformation. They also respond to temperatures in the range of 40\u201360\u00b0C, and change their response rates as a linear function of warming (in contrast with the saturating responses displayed by non-noxious thermoreceptors at high temperatures).\n\nPain signals can be separated into individual components, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called second pain or burning pain; it is poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated with referred pain."

          "heading": "Muscle Spindles",
          "text": "Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spindles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers, in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has few myofilaments and is non-contractile, but it does have one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the muscle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses.\n\nMuscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers are called alpha motor neurons, while the smaller ones supplying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are called gamma neurons. Gamma motor neurons can regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length."

          "text": "Taking Stock of Farm Financial Health Amid Rising Costs of Production and a Rapidly Changing Climate\n\nFarmers across Canada have demonstrated tremendous resilience in the face of several domestic and global events including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and extreme climate events at home and abroad. In 2022, primary agriculture contributed $36.3 billion (1.8%) of Canada's GDP and supported 249,900 jobs across the country.\n\nHowever, through this time, the cost of critical farm inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, feed, machinery, pesticides, land and labour increased dramatically. When coupled with high inflation, interest rates and a price on carbon for essential farming activities, for which farmers have no viable alternatives, Canadian producers are facing tremendous pressure on their farm financial and mental health.\n\nWhile most Canadian farmers have managed to stay afloat, largely due to high commodity prices and farm cash receipts that increased 14.6% over 2021 levels, the ongoing impact of high inflation, matched with increasing interest rates, is beginning to take a serious toll on the operating margins of Canadian producers. Recent numbers from Statistics Canada have shown that the net income for Canadian farmers fell 5.9% in 2022, because the growth in expenses outpaced the rise in farm income; and total farm operating expenses (after rebates) increased by 19.9% in 2022, the largest gain since 1979 (+21.1%).\n\nMeanwhile, while the full weight of the Bank of Canada's string of interest rate hikes has yet to sink in, farmers across Canada are experiencing an increasing series of extreme weather events that are testing the limits and effectiveness of Canada's suite of risk management programs.\n\nTo help address many of these challenges, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) has put forward recommendations in several areas aimed at not only helping farmers manage the increasing cost of production and navigate challenging regulatory barriers, but also to help them mitigate the effects of climate change and support the next generation of farmers.\n\nCanadian farmers play a crucial role in sustaining our rural communities, as stewards of our natural environment and in meeting our national and international food security needs. The following recommendations are aimed at ensuring Canada's farmers have the flexibility and tools they need to weather the current financial climate and support the transition to a low emissions economy."

However, this increase is overshadowed by a 18.6% increase in total expenses, pushing realized net income lower to $11.8 billion in 2022 from $12.8 billion, a 5.9% decrease from 2021 levels (Statistics Canada, 2023).\n\nOne of the most significant input costs for Canadian producers through 2021 and 2022 was fertilizer. According to Statistics Canada, fertilizer prices began rising rapidly in early 2021 due predominantly to high natural gas prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a 54.4% increase in 2022 (Statistics Canada, 2023).\n\nIn addition, successive droughts in Western Canada, beginning in 2021, limited the supply of hay and grain feed contributing to a 20.7% increase in commercial feed expenses for livestock producers.

          "text": "While expenses increased to record levels throughout Canada in 2022 (21.2% increase), the Farm Input Price Index (FIPI) revealed distinct regional variations. The FIPI is a measure of change in input costs faced by Canadian farmers and provides insights into the financial pressures on agricultural operations. For example, Western Canada (MB, SK, AB, BC) experienced a slightly higher increase in total farm input price rises from Q1 2019 to Q4 2022 (38%) vs. Eastern Canada (NL, PEI, NS, NB, QC, ON) (34%). Furthermore, while the cost of fuel was higher in Eastern Canada (72% vs 43%), Western Canada experienced higher feed prices (63% vs 49%).\n\nEven within the agriculture sector, certain commodities are being disproportionately impacted by financial pressures. For example, Canada's fruit and vegetable sector reported a 40% increase in input costs with fertilizer leading the way (72% increase since 2020).\n\nLabour costs have also increased by 20% and shipping by 42%. As a result, as of January 2023, 44% of fruit and vegetable producers reported that they were selling at a loss (Farmers Forum). In addition, Canada's pork industry is constrained by decreasing processor capacity and increasing non-tariff barriers to trade which means many producers are currently absorbing losses of $40 to $50 a head (RealAgriculture)."

Subjects covered include types and functions of sensory receptors in the skin (cutaneous receptors), muscles (muscle spindles), and joints (joint receptors), as well as pain pathways and proprioceptive feedback. The document specifies the mechanisms, roles, locations, and types of mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors, along with their contributions to sensory input and motor activity. It includes labeled anatomical diagrams, a comprehensive table categorizing receptor properties, and an infographic summarizing feedback loops, making it useful for answering questions about sensory receptor function, proprioception, pain transmission, and somatosensory neuroanatomy.",

None of the content has been changed in this article, but some content has been removed. Our somatosensory system consists of sensors in the skin and sensors in our muscles, tendons, and joints. The receptors in the skin, called cutaneous receptors, inform us about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and surface texture (mechanoreceptors), and pain (nociceptors). The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles."

These receptors respond with brief bursts of action potentials when encountering small surface movements. Merkel\u2019s receptors, which adapt slowly, are responsible for form and texture perception and are denser in the digits and around the mouth, but decrease in density with age. Pacinian corpuscles register vibration, while Ruffini corpuscles detect skin stretch. The distribution and depth of these receptors in hairy and glabrous skin is discussed."

The receptors in the skin, the so-called cutaneous receptors, tell us about temperature, pressure, and pain. The receptors in muscles and joints provide information about muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles. Sensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly adapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force. The slowly adapting Merkel\u2019s receptors are responsible for form and texture perception, while Pacinian corpuscles give a feeling of vibration. Nociceptors are either high-threshold mechanoreceptors or polymodal receptors."
