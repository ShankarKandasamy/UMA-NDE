seminar today uh and uh we are grateful to Dr. Gleb for
0:06
accepting our invitation. Thank you very much Dr. Glev. I know you have you are be very busy but still uh you accepted
0:14
our invitation. Thank you very much. I just want to say a few words to our members.
0:21
Um as you know all AS&T Canada has started in 2023 October October 23
0:30
uh but just after starting um we want to fly but we couldn't we couldn't for
0:38
various reasons okay so there were some changes in infrastructure changes made by AS&T our website was uh uh dismantled
0:48
and the the communication tools were not uh active. So we had some difficulties,
0:53
technical difficulties in reaching out to our members. We apologize for that. But then we are trying to revive that.
1:00
We are trying to restore the activities from the executive committee and do our
1:06
best to serve the AS&T Canada wide. So
1:12
um we thank you for your patience and we are going to be busy again starting from
1:17
this year. So hopefully all the members are able to use the membership benefits,
1:23
attend the seminars uh uh attend um what you your own speakers. I mean you we
1:31
would like to encourage all the members to come forward and uh present their uh
1:37
uh knowledge share their knowledge you know to the for the benefit of the community NDT community in Canada. Okay.
1:44
regardless of AS&T seminars. So we can't compete with AS&T. I mean ASN is so
1:49
wide. So they have so many resources but we will do our best. Uh this is Canada wide. This is going to be mostly the uh
1:58
remote seminars because of the audience the location of the audience. So uh
2:04
please feel free to uh suggest whatever topics you are interest going to be
2:10
interested and you can I mean there are so many experts in this AS&T Canada um
2:17
membership. So I would like to encourage all the experts to come forward and
2:23
share the knowledge for the benefit of everyone. Okay. So um you will be hearing soon uh about the next seminar
2:32
uh most probably going to be in in October or in November. So uh please
2:37
come forward and share your um thoughts and also try to help us in the comm in
2:44
the executive committee. We need volunteers. There are some activities we can do. For example, the website needs
2:51
to be reconstructed. The communication tools need to be uh restored. There are so many activities are there. So if you
2:58
have time if you can spare time and you can do do some some presentations or
3:04
whatever you can you can help us with volunteering we welcome you. Okay thank you very much and uh uh without much ado
3:12
I would like to introduce the speaker today uh Dr. Gleb. Thank you very much for joining. I know Dr. Glab has been a
3:19
very active uh pioneer I can say in AI technology.
3:25
So I I am impressed with this name of the company disaster I would avoidance
3:30
expertise. So that's a great name. I was very much impressed when he presented the same topic uh for the AS&T
3:38
education. So I requested Dr. Glab to come and share his knowledge for the benefit of our AS& members. Okay. So he
3:46
has been in the business for more than 20 years both academic and industrial
3:51
consulting, coaching, training for fortune 500 companies. So um I think he
3:57
he's going to give us some some snapshot of how AI tools can be used from concept
4:03
to implementation in NDT. Okay. So uh at the end of the so if you have any
4:09
questions please drop uh uh drop down in this uh chat box uh question answers and
4:16
they will be answered at the end of the presentation and also you you can reach out to Dr. Glab based on his email.
4:22
Okay. So please free to feel free to reach out to him if you have any questions or help in the future. Okay.
4:29
So without much ado I this the uh the table is with Dr. CL.
4:37
Excellent. Thank you so much for that kind introduction, Chris. Really appreciate it.
4:43
Welcome everyone. So, let's talk about AI agents in non-destructive testing.
4:49
That's the focus of today's presentation. So, that's what we want to talk about. Now, in terms of logistics,
4:55
I'll be sharing my screen in just a bit, but uh I want to put in the chat
5:02
a resource link or the resources from this presentation. So, if you want
5:10
the resources from this presentation, the resource link is in going to be in the chat. It's t i n yurl.
5:19
/d ae ev tinyurl.com
5:25
ae event. So please go to that in order to get the resources from this
5:30
presentation and it's also going to be the link that
5:36
you see under my name the post training tools and resources on how you as
5:43
MDT professionals non-destructive testing professionals can effectively use AI agents. So that's going to be
5:51
what we'll be talking about today from conception to implementation using AI agents in non-destructive testing. First
5:58
the agenda, the modern entity challenge. Then I'll look at AI agents. First
6:03
talking about the NDT challenge, what's going on, what's the context. Then we'll talk about some AI agents that are going
6:11
to be what it it is. There's a lot of jargon and hype out there. So I'll talk about what's practical and useful. Then
6:18
I'll talk about some agent ideas for you as professionals and I'll give a live demo of an agent. Then talk about the AI
6:26
agent innovation challenge workshop and how you can get started today. Finally, followed by Q&A and resources. So that's
6:33
the agenda of the presentation. That's what you can anticipate.
6:39
All right. So what are you dealing with? You have tons of documents that you're dealing with. You're spending some of
6:45
your time obviously doing testing, but you're probably spending even more of your time dealing with various forms of
6:50
paperwork from filling out reports to asynchronous communication, email, and
6:56
so on. You're looking at handbooks, technique sheets, past reports. You're trying to do research, and finding that
7:02
information and filling it out effectively is difficult. Training other technicians in your specific methods
7:08
takes a lot of time. Ensuring consistency is a lot of effort. A solution is a personalized AI
7:16
assistant that can be customized to your specific needs. An expert assistant trained on your specific documents that
7:22
understands both broad and terms and your company's
7:27
specific methods. Can answer questions and generate documents in seconds working 24/7 and ensuring consistency
7:35
not forgetting. That is the promise of an AI agent.
7:41
What do people currently do? There's Google search which is great for public web pages, searching for keywords.
7:48
There's public chat GPT tools which chat GPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Claude
7:56
andropic. It's great for general knowledge trained on the internet in general, but they don't know AS&T or
8:04
your company specific procedures. They don't have access to your private reports or manuals. And of course you
8:09
don't want to upload proprietary data to public tools that will be trained on in terms of the kind of company regulations
8:16
and procedures. They probably have limitations on that there. So their answers can be too specific for your
8:22
specialized entity work. So what you want is a tool built for you that knows your documents, can access your own
8:28
information. It's a private expert system that you can control.
8:34
So what is a custom AI agent? It's a digital apprentice like an intern. Think of it as an intern. Train it on your
8:41
expert knowledge. Think of it as like a smart college freshman. So that's
8:46
probably the equivalent that you want to think about or maybe a very advanced high school senior college freshman is
8:53
probably a better modality. It learns to perform specific tasks for you. It's built from three core components. First
9:00
is the large language model and there are several that you can choose. One is the clawed opus 4.1 that's entropic. One
9:08
is openai's GPT5 and another is Gemini 2.5 pro. Those are the most advanced ones at this stage. Microsoft copilot
9:16
uses GPT5 in its back end. So I'm not listing it as the large language model.
9:21
But if you're using Microsoft Copilot, it's just as good as using GPT5 with some limitations. Not some limitations,
9:28
some particularities. So think of it as a brilliant new hire. Again, fresh from university, not a sen,
9:34
not a college senior, but a college freshman. It can read, write, and reason. Great. But it doesn't have
9:39
entity experience. Then your documents, your training material that you provide to the sprint.
9:45
A private library of your handbooks and standard operating procedures, reports, technique sheets, everything. The agent
9:52
will rely on information from this library that you provide won't search the public internet for answers unless
9:57
you directed to do so. And finally, the skill set. your instructions, your job
10:03
description, what you tell this college intern to do. Simple plain language
10:09
English instructions. That's a nice thing. You don't need to know coding. It's just natural language programming.
10:14
It's you just write those instructions. The secret sauce is getting the instructions right. You'll spend most of
10:20
your time and effort here because you have already the pre-built large language model. Then you have your
10:25
existing knowledge corpus that you feed into it. The challenge is having the
10:31
instructions be correct. So you'll need to experiment with different instructions. That's what you'll spend most of your time creating an agent to
10:38
figure out what works best. Again, if you work with entity reports, if you
10:44
have a good grasp of English, you'll be fine. How it all works together. So you ask the agent for a task in plain text.
10:53
It consults its private knowledge library. It follows your instructions. That's the skills and it provides an
10:58
expert answer based on your data. Why this matters? It'll provide you with
11:04
trusted proprietary answers. Your data will be private. It won't leave your environment if you get the paid version.
11:10
That's the enterprise version. So here we're only talking about enterprise versions. By the way, I'm to be very
11:16
clear. We're talking about paid versions. So there are two types for each of those language models that I
11:22
talked about. Gemini, Claudropic and GPT5.
11:30
Those have well three versions. One is the public free version that's just
11:35
automatically trained on your data. The reason they're giving you access to it is because they're training on your data. You have the paid personal
11:42
version. Now, in the paid personal version, you need to
11:49
go through some hoops to make sure that your data is not trained on to opt out of the default setting, which is the
11:56
default settings that your data is paid on. And then some tools like Gemini, you'll have some limitations on the tool
12:02
if you opt out of the paid of the data sharing. And finally, you have the
12:08
enterprise version. The enterprise version is completely secure. it will there's no like opt-in route. It will
12:15
not train on your data. So by default your data will not be trained on. You can probably opt into training on your
12:22
data if you're an enterprise but why would you do it? So that's great. That's
12:28
the data privacy part. So I just wanted to clarify that. I know not of folks have questions about it. If you have
12:33
questions about it more you can pop into the chat. Now it's going to be efficient. It'll sell you automate
12:40
repetitive tasks and free up your time as an expert. Let's talk about some
12:46
practical agents you can build. Entity report generator, method selector and advisor, technique sheet generator,
12:51
buyer guide advisor, and equipment advisor. What's an report generator? So you have raw entity data. you have you
12:58
ran some kind of testing procedure, you know, ultra
13:04
radioactive testing, ultrasound testing, and then you want to turn it into a formatted report. That's great. As a
13:11
tool, it'll take you a while to do by hand, but this tool will make it very easy and quick if you put your notes
13:18
into it. So reduces report writing time from hours to minutes. Ensures consistent terminology and format,
13:25
follows your standards and procedures and of course you want your technicians you to review and approve it before
13:31
finalization. So that's one tool that you can build and again that can be highly useful save you a lot of time.
13:38
Another is a method selective advisor. So if you think of the variety of methods that you can select and
13:44
especially for tasks that you might not be as familiar with it can and or some
13:50
new tasks innovative ones maybe new tools that came out. It can recommend optimal methods based on material
13:56
geometry and defect type ranks methods by effectiveness cost and time requirements highlighting limitations
14:02
and challenges. It cites relevant standards and procedures from your library or the AS&T library depending on
14:10
what documents you upload into it and helps train new technicians especially in method selection rationale but also
14:16
helps experienced technicians with new areas. Technique sheet generator creates the
14:22
detailed technique sheets for any method step-by-step procedures equipment list safety protocols helps you ensure
14:28
compliance with AS&T standards your own company procedures. It updates automatically when standards or
14:34
procedures change when you upload those into the knowledge base. And of course,
14:39
again, you'd have expert review and approval before finalizing. Fourth idea, help you make better
14:46
equipment purchasing decisions. You probably don't know all the equipment that's out there, especially new stuff.
14:52
So, this helps you compare features, specifications, and prices across vendors with cost benefit ratios. helps
14:58
you use your organization's past purchasing experiences and detailed purchase justification reports which are
15:05
a hassle and take a lot of time. Another idea is an equipment advisor that can monitor equipment health and
15:11
performance, create maintenance schedules, provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance, tracks
15:16
calibration history, recalibration needs, and maintains complete history equipment history for compliance. So
15:23
those are some ideas of tools and let me
15:29
share with you some tool examples just so you
15:34
understand how they work.
15:44
All right. So this is an entity report generator.
15:57
And here is a prompt that you put into it. So generate the full 18 deliverable pipeline.
16:03
Just some notes that you would take after doing a test for radiographic test of weld IFL W using the following
16:11
information. the source the SFD source size film exposure calculated UG and
16:16
density compliance IQI acceptance criteria and so on the inspectors who
16:22
signed off so just notes that you have and then it'll take
16:28
Can you can you share the screen please I don't think I have seen the screen are you sharing the screen
16:35
yes that's right you should be able to see see the screen with the AS&T entity
16:40
report generator is someone who's not seeing it. Yeah, he's right there on the screen.
16:46
Yeah. Okay. All right. I am not it. Thank you. Yeah, this is it. So, you should be able
16:52
to see it. Mhm. So, this is the report generator tool. So, you'll notice this is in chat
16:58
GPT just using chat GPT. Again, you can use for this you can use cloud entropic
17:04
of which it's going to be right next to it. I use all three tools of
17:10
you can that's another one that you can use. You can use Gemini.
17:16
So another quite useful tool of if you have extensive Microsoft tools I just
17:22
recommend using Microsoft Copilot because they'll be integrated into the ecosystem. And so that's going to be the
17:30
uh tools that you want to use. So this in the meantime
17:36
you can click on so this is what's it'll take a couple of minutes to generate this information
17:43
but uh the crucial thing that you can do is in the meantime you can see what it's doing. So here was the prompt and here
17:51
it's reading certain documents need to make assumptions about the pipel
17:56
thickness maybe 12 mm thickness is unknown need to document assumptions carefully
18:02
the required densities windows between two and four and so you can see as you're developing the tool over time
18:10
you'll have your first version of instructions and I'll show you the instructions in a bit and you'll see
18:17
how The tool responds to your instructions through its internal thinking process and you should say okay
18:24
is it following ASME five article two of this is this right does this make sense
18:32
like I'm not an expert in this you're an expert in this or whatever area that you want to make an expertise you need to
18:37
make sure the report includes necessary personnel info signatures the uploaded files RTN standards in front of citation
18:45
token create content objects So you'll see what it's doing. Oh, so aging
18:50
deliverables and so on now.
18:57
So you can always observe what's going on. And now here it's just
19:03
generating these objects, the output. Now let's take a look at the actual back
19:09
end of this tool before we look at the output. So this has a document
19:18
that comprises what all the information on non-destructive testing and it just
19:25
has all the information. So this was from a using AS&T standards. They
19:31
provided me with a docu with their documentation on standards for creating reports and I developed this document
19:39
based on their standards. So this is just a document that contains their standards.
19:45
Here is the crucial thing for the instructions. So instructions mission non-stop policy run completion complain
19:53
deliverable pipeline always use code interpreter for every operation never align external service or mock links
20:00
click only emit only clickable sandbox links locking gates or pre-flight gates
20:07
sanitize the input. We compute unique file names. So again, you could see this
20:12
is all natural language programming. You don't have to do any coding. You just have to understand how to communicate to
20:18
it. Build canonical source content. Deliver render all derivative formats.
20:26
Verification gate JSON. So this is just talks about the the outputs that it will
20:31
create. Regx for leng targets.
20:36
So this is where it's talking about the kind of things that must be created
20:41
comprehensive report analysis supervisor menu and so on referencing with these
20:49
standards.
20:57
All of these standards are going to be in the longer document here of non-destructive testing that it can
21:03
reference. So site the standards and any internal knowledge and document consulted must
21:09
explicitly demonstrate parameter compliance density geometric and sharpness of use iqi sensitivity screens
21:18
just some examples. So supervisor memo must reference the governing standards how concisely
21:25
computer checks were applicable deliverables then that's just talking
21:30
about what the deliverables are as a result of all of this
21:37
and then emitting all the emitment report format tone numeric ranges parameters from the
21:45
source notes all of this technical information that's going to be applicable. So again you could see it's
21:51
just natural language programming. You don't have to know any coding to do this. Analysis format just gives you
21:58
what format you want to see. Supervisor memo format. So again this is where you choose your own format whatever works
22:05
for you. What the tone what the tone is and so on.
22:10
Deliverables manifest and audit strict non-stop rules
22:17
and so on. Let's see.
22:24
Let me see if I can I'll show a different window with the actual
22:31
document so that you see what the document is that contains
22:37
the report generator information.
23:32
Okay.
23:38
Yeah. Okay. Good. So, you should be able to see this document. And so this is the
23:44
document you see it's a pretty long one 25,000 words that talks about the
23:49
methods. So that's the knowledge document that's uploaded into the back end and it talks about
23:58
all of these methods. So visual testing most fundamental entity method surface observation technique variance reference
24:05
standards acceptment criteria equipment and calibration common defects detected and so on. reporting practices. Then
24:13
talks about liquid penetration testing as another method. Then it talks about
24:19
all this other stuff, magnetic particle testing. And so and it references
24:25
various standards. And so as you see it's giving going
24:30
through this information and it's giving information that AS&T folks should have
24:36
and what it should site in its outcomes and its reports. So this is the kind of
24:43
information that you would want for the back end of your own tool.
24:55
Okay.
25:04
Great.
25:19
[Music]
25:25
Okay. So we had where was this?
25:31
Okay. So here we go. So here's the outcome of the report
25:37
of the agent scope and references. So describes making sure what references are going to be cited. Setup and
25:44
calibration describe setup and calibration. Results disposition attachments. Then gives a
25:51
JSON which you can put into your computer. So this is just for you to use
25:56
in your computers easily.
26:02
Then give source basis standards and kit gives recommendations interpretation
26:08
versus acceptance criteria recommendations that you should repair this weld to confirm removal of
26:14
indications maintain size assumptions and so on. Subject repair rejecting
26:20
repair required date and so on. why it matters and now here it's giving some
26:27
reports that you can download automatically in various formats some
26:32
text format JSON PDF docx so if you want those
26:37
you can just upload download them automatically Okay.
27:07
Okay. So that's one example of a tool. So you saw the kind of outcomes. Let me
27:13
I ran another one so that uh just so you see
27:19
like in the meantime while we're waiting for it for this one. I also ran another one
27:25
separate window. So that was for
27:35
radiographic testing and here's one for ultrasonic testing
27:42
pipeline. So you could see the full report scope and references
27:47
setup and calibration coverage and conditions results disposition attachment signatures. You have a JSON
27:53
of the report. You have an analysis of the report. And you have a memo for a supervisor to
28:03
if you want to send that memo to a supervisor to report on it. Why it matters,
28:10
world failed acceptance must be repaired, what was done, key factual outcomes, risks and impact, budget
28:16
considerations, decisions needed, and so on. And so here like think about how much
28:24
time this would take you to create. This would take a lot of time to create for
28:30
you. But here this was created in a very short amount of time. You saw that it
28:36
took like about 5 minutes or so to create this outcome. So this is the
28:42
benefit of having a agent like this one that can provide information.
28:49
That's so helpful.
28:54
Oh, then you would need to upgrade it to a plus or pro version.
29:02
Let's take a look at another tool.
29:12
Let's talk about let's say a
29:18
of buyer's guide advisor. So let's say you're trying to buy something.
29:26
So this tool that I mentioned earlier the how it works it's a vendor agnostic
29:31
buying advisor for all entity methods and equipment. So, you want to buy
29:37
something, you say something like create a buyer brief for corrosion inspections on 24-in carbon steel pipelines or a GF
29:44
coast refinery, including environment, access, temperature, and safety conditions. If you have
29:50
another idea that you want to test out, I can I can run another version of this,
29:56
the same buyers advisor, and test out something else. So if you have some idea
30:04
that of something that you might need to buy, just put it into the chat.
30:13
Give you a few seconds to put any ideas into the chat that you want to see if you want to buy something or like the
30:20
kind of purchases that you make.
30:35
So, in the meantime, you could see what this one's doing.
30:41
So, again, while I'm waiting for anyone to put anything to the chat, you I can have other sample prompts
30:48
that I can run. Um, but
30:55
here I'll do another sample prompt with help me pick the right NDT method to find 2 millm surface breaking cracks
31:01
aluminum aircraft skins without disassembly. Okay, so in the meantime, let's go to
31:08
the buyer brief for corrosion inspections and 24-in carbon pipelines G Coast refinery.
31:14
So here we see it's thinking the user's request is clear.
31:22
That's good. So, it knows what it's talking about. Haven't used the correct method to retrieve a specific document yet. Tackle tasks. Need specific
31:29
queries. Create search query targeting key aspects of the task.
31:34
Source quilter. So, you could see that it's getting some errors. Needs to define a source code filter that
31:40
deciding that files uploaded in conversation. It's including source filter site from our research reports.
31:46
So, checking the DMX companies list for vendor guides. to the GF Coast Provenence. That's part of the
31:53
information in the back end that's uh coming from AS&T, their standard buyer guide, which you should all have access
31:59
to as members. GF coast are thinking about which areas to include.
32:05
Make sure to include whatever gathering everything required, GF coast refinery, environment is tough,
32:12
humid, salt, tear, hot conditions. So, it's considering all of that. focusing equipment like UT thickness gauges
32:20
of course you know if you're in Canada you have your own tough environment in a different way
32:26
cold and whatnot might be rainy might be whatever it might be if you're on the coast obviously salty radiographic
32:33
seclusion zones and permits so it's thinking about these details
32:38
so thinking about this by the way again if you want to test this out and you want to have an idea of something you
32:44
want to buy Okay. Um, let's see. Okay, somebody has an idea.
32:51
Let me put it in.
33:04
Okay, I'll give it let's give it some time to think about
33:11
that. So, good. Thank you for the sample. All right. So, in the meantime, it came
33:19
up with buyers brief tailored to corrosion inspections, 24-in carbon steel pipelines or G Coast refinery. So,
33:27
buyer brief corrosion inspections application summary. What's the objective? Find find, quantify, and map
33:33
external internal corrosion material. Here's the material.
33:39
Here's the governance critical outputs minimal remaining wall
33:46
thickness corrosion and so on. Environmental constraints. So it's considering all of this field use with
33:51
humidity salt air rain and sun requires rug portable battery powered instruments with weather protection data handling
33:58
matters standardized formats access constraints congested racks insulation cladding and so on.
34:05
Jex scanners and geek robotics common choices. So it's already narrowing it down. Specify high temperature treaty
34:12
couples and probes for insurface assessments and hot lines. Treat units as operating in hazardous areas class
34:19

34:26
approach and why screening for QI for insulation pulse steady current to
34:31
locate and prioritize wall loss under insulation. Quantification, mapping of corrosion to
34:37
make sure that's done. Performance requirements this provisional QUI
34:42
screening UT thickness hot mapping what's the hardware looking at data and
34:47
software accessories and reference standards. So any of these can be changed. So as you're going through it
34:53
you can see okay you know maybe UT thickness needs to be different or maybe
34:59
accessories and reference standards you want something different. You can go back and say
35:05
everything except of 0.9 like in nine change this to that and rerun the
35:12
analysis and they'll rerun the analysis for you. But here's the outcome. Provisional vendor short list equipment
35:19
and local support evidence scientific for UTP instruments and RVI way gate
35:25
technologies technologies Magnaflux and then regional distributions and service providers who provide these
35:32
services. Then gives you an RFQ draft that you can just email them.
35:42
Hold on. supply a portable PC system for QUI screening and so on. So this is the RFQ
35:50
the applications 24 you know DCD. So this gives you something that you can
35:56
email to any of these companies to all of these companies and see what they come up with for you instrument
36:02
requirements probe scanners and so on. then gives you a quote comparison matrix
36:08
looking at various elements and a five-year total cost of ownership model.
36:15
So giving you some example prices and how much it will cost
36:22
and then assumptions and open items to confirm and so said they can turn this into RFQ
36:29
email draft address to short list and so on and so these are additional points you can use once you go for this.
36:40
So, uh, Chris asks about NDT reports. You can certainly develop, I didn't do
36:46
it for this tool, but you can certainly develop a tool, an agent that does exactly what you're asking with a sketch
36:52
or photo. It's AI AI tools are great at image generation.
36:58
Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so let's go back to this other
37:04
question that was there about adhesive tape which would apply on aluminum surfaces meet the P main at 60°
37:12
condition. Okay, short answer if tape must be a pressure sensitive adhesive you can
37:18
stick at room temperature which is MFA at 60 degrees in aluminum is unrealistic.
37:25
So free ozone design for VHP tapes under dynamic is share and so on. If you can use a structural adhesive film, several
37:33
proven products exceed the margin of need. So here's a short list.
37:41
3M Scotchwell structural adhesive film data point providing information here. You can link to this again. Product
37:49
page. Salv liquid adhesive overview. Salv epoxy film adhesive 3M structural
37:57
adhesive. It gives why these are not regular double PSA tape. So here it gives an
38:04
explanation at 60 degrees in aluminum is not going
38:10
to work out. And here it's going giving quick buyer details that you can go to. And then
38:17
giving specifying your RFQ. So having an RFQ
38:23
starter vendor list it gives you a starter vendor list. So you can go to this
38:28
and see it gives you this film.
38:35
Same thing here. Same thing here. The best candidate if you must use a PSA
38:40
tape but no published evidence on 60° aluminum.
38:49
You're welcome. Ben. Okay. So,
38:57
so there you go on how on the actual tools itself. Now, those
39:05
are just two examples and there are plenty plenty more as you can imagine of
39:10
agents that you can use, but I hope that gives you a flavor of the actual agents
39:16
and their usefulness and how quicker much quicker they are to use than if you
39:23
used either public chat GPT or an unspecified tool or just did it yourself. So, let's talk about this
39:30
process of implementing it. First you document all your information, then create a knowledge base, define its
39:37
purpose with instructions, test and refine it, and then deploy. So here you gather your documents, whatever you
39:42
want, handbooks, technique sheets, reports, PDFs, and documents. Again, enterprise account if you want to keep
39:49
them private. The knowledge base, the documents are processed and converted. They're uploaded like I showed you to
39:55
the machine readable format and then connections between related concepts are established. Then do you get the
40:02
instructions? So here's the key. That's the key. The instructions are the key that I showed you. Define the agent
40:07
specific purpose and scope. Primary users and needs. The key tasks for the agent. Configure the agents technical
40:13
parameters. Test then test and refine. Test it with real world scenarios. Improve their relevance, accuracy, and
40:20
completeness. And as you test it, change the instructions over time. Conduct user acceptance testing. Then deploy. Deploy
40:28
the agent in your secure environment. provide training for your team and create some documentation on using it.
40:34
Monitor usage and collect feedback for improvements. You'll get a lot of benefits. It'll save you. You saw these
40:40
two tools already. These two tools using those will save you a bunch of time, right? If you build those for yourself
40:46
and customize them to your needs, especially it'll be consistent to your needs in practice. It will preserve
40:53
expertise as experienced staff retire and frees up experts to focus on high value activities.
40:59
So you can put this agent on the design and build your own agent
41:05
that will be at the conference the AS&T conference coming up in like less than a week. So make sure to check it out. So
41:14
facilitating a workshop that you need to register for if you want to attend. It's free to attend but you need to register
41:21
for it. So we'll have a workshop then a guided build session and final by team
41:27
presentations at judging at the conference. So again you can go to it and you can sign up for it. Okay so
41:34
that's what I want to share. You now have the value the ingredients to build a powerful AI the skills and your expert
41:42
knowledge. It's accessible to you right now. It can help you save time reduce errors and ensure consistency. So what I
41:48
suggest is you identify one task like entity report generation or the buyer's guide or whatever. Gather your
41:55
knowledge, explore the platforms that you want to use, get training, register for the workshop, get some coaching with
42:00
me and build a useful agent over time. So for the resources, I'll do a poll in
42:07
a bit, but you can also go to tanyaur.com aeved n. I shared the link in the chat.
42:15
tanya.comd aeve nt for a copy of today's
42:21
presentation slides. I'll be happy to give you a coaching demo and a copy of my book chat GPT for leaders and content
42:27
creators and and
42:35
here is a poll. Uh so soly
42:41
of you asked how to build your own private tool.
42:46
You'll want to get into I'll let me share my screen so that you can see uh
42:54
what I'm talking about. Hold on. So in chat GPT just for quick nest for
43:03
demonstration. So let's go to the main chat GPT screen.
43:13
So you want to go to
43:18
explore GPTs. Then you want to click on create. And here is how you configure
43:24
it. So here's the name, here's the description, here's the instructions, here's the knowledge base. So that's
43:31
very simple. Same thing for Gemini. It's just going to be called a gem here.
43:37
And you can create a new gem. Again, same idea. Give it a name, give your
43:44
instructions, and add your knowledge piece. And same thing with entropic.
43:50
[Music]
44:01
Okay. Are there any questions on any aspects of uh the presentation?
44:11
Okay. Couple of questions. Sorry. Go ahead.
44:19
Good morning. Um I see there is a lot of potential for uh
44:26
uh like uh avoid any
44:31
missing uh misinformation about results like uh getting all the data from um
44:38
wave for example in ultrasound or acoustic mission about all the waves uh
44:45
uh you know populating and separating all this data from good data from bad
44:52
data and stuff like that. I think there is a lot of potential using EI for
44:58
giving um um valid results on uh on
45:03
reports. Yeah, there's a lot of potential. The
45:10
question is, yeah, the question is we could use EI toident
45:15
identify and separate good data through uh to bad data on uh on uh results of uh
45:25
um resource you know ultrasound is based in
45:31
waves all the way that receiving for the transducers. So and um and there is a
45:38
lot of visual visual and um
45:43
object judgment on the on the results. So we could use EI to
45:51
get all this data and put it on the on on EI and give it the result by
45:56
themselves instead of being like subjective
46:02
subjective uh uh human
46:08
judgment. So in terms of using AI what you'll
46:14
there are a couple of things to think about. one is garbage in garbage out. So you'll make sure you'll want to make
46:20
sure to always have AI that whenever you
46:26
use AI to make sure that it's going to be
46:33
fed the right data. So it will only provide the right data if you feed it the right data. Now, if your goal is to
46:40
try to use AI to differentiate bad data from good data, you need to
46:46
provide it with a standard of what good data and bad data looks like. And so you
46:53
can provide it with AS&T standards and other standards that would show it what
46:59
good data and bad data look like. And then you can ask it to differentiate good data from bad data. So that's one
47:04
tool that you can build. Yes. But you would have to first provide it with that
47:10
information for how to differentiate good data from bad data.
47:16
Now Vin asks how to keep data secure if you have to train your own the model. So
47:21
that's what I would suggest at that stage that you'll want to get an enterprise account if you want to keep
47:29
your data really secure or if you get a personal account, not an enterprise
47:35
account, then you'll want to learn exactly how the data settings work so that it you don't do training so that
47:43
they're not allowed to do training on your account. So you opt out of various sharing.
47:55
Uh then somebody asks how can you ensure the validity and relability of the information it
48:00
generates. So that's it generates informations based on the information
48:06
that you provide. In other words, it's not using random data that it found
48:12
elsewhere. You provide it with a standard. So you saw that the information that I the the text that I
48:18
provided it in the back end you want to make sure that it has the right information about what are the standards
48:24
from AS&T from your company and then you want to make sure so that's the knowledge and the instructions
48:31
that's the knowledge and the instructions that's the back end and then the front end is what prompt you're giving it so that's the only information
48:37
that it has and so it will be using that information to generate the report and so whatever report you generate like
48:45
here I can show you like the final outcome for example uh
48:51
so here is the final outcome of the report so it
48:58
gives you all the report information then gives you a link you can download everything
49:06
in a zip file or you can download individual ones and what you'll
49:13
See, I should share my screen. Okay, somebody is doesn't have their
49:19
Please turn off your microphones. You're making background sounds. Thank you.
49:28
So, here's the report from the zip file. So, you could see
49:34
it's four types of formats. memos, reports. So let's say let let's take a
49:42
look at this report. So if you want to use a report, word
49:47
report, you know, it's nicely formatted. It gives you scope and references, setup and calibration, coverage and
49:53
conditions, results, disposition, attachments, signature, standards. So it gives you all the information that it
49:59
used for compiling the report.
50:04
And same thing for the let's say if you want to take a look at the supervisor menu
50:11
supervisor memo. So it gives you the supervisor memo, the subject line that
50:17
you want to send to the supervisor and then gives you the links in the report
50:22
analysis, why it matters, what was done, key factual outcomes, risks and impacts,
50:29
budget and considerations, approval, next actions. So all of this is based on
50:35
the information that you gave it and it's using this information to come up with an outcome. So it's just formatting
50:42
the information, putting it into the format into the template that you want to make sure that it has. And so
50:49
ensuring the product is aligned with the latest versions of relevant standards, that's just up to you to upload the
50:56
latest versions of the relevant standards into the database into that knowledge document. So I showed you the
51:03
knowledge document. So you just make sure that whenever there's a new standard comes out, you upload it into
51:09
the knowledge document and into the knowledge base and it has the knowledge base in it. They'll be using it.
51:17
All right, other questions. Yeah, actually I have one already
51:24
mentioned it. My apologies. I was dealing with some other stuff here. Um so is there some sort of a margin of
51:31
error that was um put forth using this AI? So for example, if we input um an RT
51:39
procedure and then we input the code code effective date and technical
51:44
specification and what not and then it does this thing. Um have you ever
51:49
established the margin of error for the final report that is produced by AI?
51:56
when you're talking about margin of error. So, let's let's just take a look at the report. Hold on.
52:04
So, here's the information that you provided for it. And then you're talking about the
52:11
acceptance criteria, standards, source, film, exposure,
52:17
wires, coverage conditions, results, disposition, attachments and so on. Uh
52:25
so these are the kinds of things that it gives you and what the results are
52:31
including if it's not a good fit. So that says this was not within the margin of error.
52:39
Basically one eleg inclusion of 12 m is detected per API acceptance. This
52:46
doesn't fit within the accepted margin of error. So the repair weld must be
52:52
revised considering capture and gives you the confidence of its score
52:59
for how confident it is in its analysis. So it gives you a margin of error that
53:04
way in terms of like how confident I am in my analysis and also very clearly
53:10
says that based on my analysis and the standards that are existing this is not within the existing margin of error and
53:18
reject and repair is required. And of course if reject and repair
53:23
wasn't required then it would say that other folks
53:36
Uh, sure. I have a I have a question or a point to make, I guess. Um,
53:41
so I use chat GBT. I I pay for it. Um, and I found it really useful. Um, and I
53:48
I did what you did where you make your mind GBT, you know, and you you feed it a bunch of PDFs and then you give it a
53:55
command list. Um, and I found it useful to compile information generally, but I guess this is just kind of a, you know,
54:02
a caution from from uh I'm sure you would agree, but just a caution for everybody uh that when you get this
54:08
information, um, it doesn't replace the expert. Um, because it's just a dumb LLM
54:15
and it's just, you know, linking word to word and trying to make sense of this in its own little mathematical way. I spend
54:23
probably more time arguing with chat GPT about what it missed because I I'll know
54:29
that there's a clause in say W59 that uh you know specifies X Y and Zed and uh it
54:37
will misconrue the data which is in W59 or do a poor cross reference and I think
54:43
to somebody who's not an expert in that territory they may just assume that you know the great computer god has
54:49
given me this gift of information this is the greatest and they just run with it and I I see this happening
54:56
Um, I I guess on the surface you you can see these little these little plants sprout up on LinkedIn where people
55:02
publish these great big long, you know, here's a information on uh welds and uh
55:10
I saw some one the other day where somebody had a the world's worst AI illustrations of welds that have ever
55:16
existed. It was just awful. And they posted this long post like I'm a genius, you know, hire me. And I think people
55:22
just have to be cautious that when they use these tools, it doesn't replace the expert. The expert always has to be at
55:28
the end double-checking. And you're you're right to equate it to a um like a like a brilliant freshman, right, who's
55:35
really excellent and fast and eyes on task for compiling information, but they
55:41
don't have the experience and uh wherewithal to separate, you know, fact
55:48
from fiction. they just kind of regurgitate and blow it out there and you as the boss have to come in and and
55:55
assume something's wrong. It's a good way of thinking about it. Uh
56:01
so here I mentioned in the presentation that you as a technician can re have to
56:07
review and approve before finalization. Same thing for like this one allows for
56:13
expert review and approval before finalization. So in all cases, it doesn't replace your expert human
56:19
judgment. It's a tool that helps you replace a bunch of the busy work that you would have to do. So it's great for
56:27
getting a report and formatting it, but of course it will not always get it 100% correct. So as Paul pointed out, you
56:34
need to review and approve it and before finalization. The same thing for the
56:41
purchasing like the let's say if it's writing that RFQ for the purchase you
56:46
need to review and approve it before sending it to the vendor because it
56:51
might not get something right that you know is going to be particular to your situation. It might get something off.
56:58
So absolutely you need to always review the output and approve it because it's not going to be perfect for a whole
57:05
variety of reasons.
57:22
Chris, uh, I think we I we can't hear you if you're trying to speak.
57:28
Okay. Can you see my question? Yes. Okay, let me take a look. Yeah.
57:33
How does the I tool help to evaluate the POD for a given specimen and the NDT method? Uh, so we don't really have So
57:41
that's one of the other agents I have available, but we don't have time for me to demonstrate unfortunately. I I will
57:47
talk more about it at the Yep. But that's one of the other it's one of the agents I built to
57:53
showcase at the workshop at the conference in six days. So if you come
58:00
to the conference, you'll get to see it. Very good. Okay. So unfortunately I'll
58:05
be missing this conference but anyway so we can catch up later on. So absolutely. Anyway, so are there any more questions
58:12
from the audience? I see I don't see any other questions in the chat uh area.
58:20
So if no more questions on this uh topic, I really would like to uh thank
58:27
Dr. Clap. Thank you very much for your uh time and sharing your knowledge for
58:33
the benefit of our members. really appreciate it and we will be definitely in touch with you and all the
58:40
individuals are free to contact him based on his email address and uh you
58:46
can you can see his question there in the in the in this in the screen. So please feel free to contact him after
58:53
this seminar if you have any more questions and he will be able to It's okay just just to clarify the AS&T
58:59
Canada will provide me with the email addresses of the folks who wanted the
59:04
emails resources and so then if you voted so just to make sure that people
59:10
understand what it means if you voted for getting the email resources then you'll get the resources after the
59:17
presentation right from my email and other resources that I'll send you over time.
59:22
Very good. Okay. Thank you very much and uh thank you all for attending this
59:27
seminar. So hope you gained something some very important uh uh information
59:33
about AI agents and how you can apply that in your practical situations. Hopefully going forward we'll be hearing
59:40
more more about the AI tools in NDT and how we can make entity very effectively
59:46
efficiently in our workplace. Okay. So u please stay tuned for the further
59:52
developments in the um as Canada uh section and also feel free to uh be in
59:58
touch with us uh if you have um some knowledge to share you are welcome to
1:00:05
present anything um and also please let us know what type of uh uh presentations
1:00:11
you would like to in the future. uh we will be collaborating with uh some of you um and if you are interested to
1:00:17
volunteer please feel free to uh uh contact me or beta hina please. Okay. Uh
1:00:25
thank you Beta for uh organizing this event. I really appreciate it and we
1:00:30
will uh look forward to see you again in next event. Okay. Thank you. Thank you all.
1:00:38
Thank you everyone. Thank you Dr. Thank you everyone. Byebye.
1:00:43
Bye. Bye. Bye.
