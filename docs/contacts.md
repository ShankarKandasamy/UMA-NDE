Uh, sure. I have a I have a question or a point to make, I guess. Um,
53:41
so I use chat GBT. I I pay for it. Um, and I found it really useful. Um, and I
53:48
I did what you did where you make your mind GBT, you know, and you you feed it a bunch of PDFs and then you give it a
53:55
command list. Um, and I found it useful to compile information generally, but I guess this is just kind of a, you know,
54:02
a caution from from uh I'm sure you would agree, but just a caution for everybody uh that when you get this
54:08
information, um, it doesn't replace the expert. Um, because it's just a dumb LLM
54:15
and it's just, you know, linking word to word and trying to make sense of this in its own little mathematical way. I spend
54:23
probably more time arguing with chat GPT about what it missed because I I'll know
54:29
that there's a clause in say W59 that uh you know specifies X Y and Zed and uh it
54:37
will misconrue the data which is in W59 or do a poor cross reference and I think
54:43
to somebody who's not an expert in that territory they may just assume that you know the great computer god has
54:49
given me this gift of information this is the greatest and they just run with it and I I see this happening
54:56
Um, I I guess on the surface you you can see these little these little plants sprout up on LinkedIn where people
55:02
publish these great big long, you know, here's a information on uh welds and uh
55:10
I saw some one the other day where somebody had a the world's worst AI illustrations of welds that have ever
55:16
existed. It was just awful. And they posted this long post like I'm a genius, you know, hire me. And I think people
55:22
just have to be cautious that when they use these tools, it doesn't replace the expert. The expert always has to be at
55:28
the end double-checking. And you're you're right to equate it to a um like a like a brilliant freshman, right, who's
55:35
really excellent and fast and eyes on task for compiling information, but they
55:41
don't have the experience and uh wherewithal to separate, you know, fact
55:48
from fiction. they just kind of regurgitate and blow it out there and you as the boss have to come in and and
55:55
assume something's wrong.
