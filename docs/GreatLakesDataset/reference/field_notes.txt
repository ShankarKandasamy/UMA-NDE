DAY 1 - Monday, November 4, 2024
Weather: Partly cloudy, 48°F/35°F
Crew: M. Chen (Lead), S. Thompson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:00 - Arrived at GLCP gate. Completed daily sign-in and obtained visitor 
        badges. Met with Mike Sullivan (GLCP Safety) for daily permit review.
        
07:30 - Safety orientation/tailgate meeting at staging area. Reviewed JSA with
        Tom Bradley (Area Operator). H2S monitors issued and tested.
        
08:00 - Started inspection at Sour Gas Inlet lines (6-SG-101, 6-SG-102).
        Good access at grade level. All CMLs accessible.
        
09:45 - Completed 6-SG-101 (8 CMLs). No issues. Readings within expected range.
        
10:30 - Started 6-SG-102. NOTE: CML 6-SG-102-04 - forgot to take photo of gauge
        display. Will need to note in report.  [ERROR - missing photo]
        
11:30 - Completed 6-SG-102 (6 CMLs). Started on Lean Amine lines 4-LA-101.
        
12:00 - LUNCH BREAK (at Gate 2 cafeteria)

13:00 - Resumed work on 4-LA-101 and 4-LA-102. Working from scaffolding at
        elevated locations near pipe rack.
        
14:30 - Sarah noticed one reading entry may have had wrong format - will need 
        to check data export. CML 4-LA-102-03 entered without dashes.
        
15:45 - Completed Day 1 scope. 40 CMLs total.
        
16:00 - End of shift. Cleaned up staging area. Returned H2S monitors to 
        control room.

Daily Summary:
- CMLs Completed: 40
- Lines Completed: 6-SG-101, 6-SG-102, 4-LA-101, 4-LA-102
- Issues: Missing photo at 6-SG-102-04, possible data format issue
- All readings acceptable, no critical findings today


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 2 - Tuesday, November 5, 2024
Weather: Rain in AM, clearing by noon, 52°F/41°F
Crew: M. Chen (Lead), S. Thompson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:00 - Arrived on site. Rain continuing from overnight.

07:30 - Tailgate meeting. Decision to delay outdoor elevated work until rain
        stops. Started with grade-level CMLs on 6-LA-103 that are under pipe
        rack cover.
        
08:15 - Working on 6-LA-103 Lean Amine Header. Good coverage under pipe rack.

09:30 - ISSUE: CML 6-LA-103-08 - scaffold could not reach location due to
        obstruction from instrument junction box. Photographed location and 
        documented as inaccessible. Will need to note in report.
        
10:45 - Rain stopped. Moved to elevated work on Rich Amine lines.

11:00 - Started 4-RA-101 (high priority line per GLCP). Taking extra care
        documenting all readings.
        
11:45 - *** CRITICAL FINDING *** 
        CML 4-RA-101-06: Reading 0.142" which is BELOW t-min of 0.150"
        Immediately notified Jennifer Walsh (GLCP Inspection Coordinator)
        via radio. She came to location to verify.
        Re-measured 3 times, confirmed reading. Multiple photos taken.
        Jennifer initiating fitness-for-service evaluation.
        
12:30 - LUNCH BREAK

13:30 - Continued 4-RA-101. Remaining CMLs within acceptable range.

14:15 - Started 4-RA-102. Sarah handling this line while I finish 4-RA-101.

15:00 - Note: Sarah reported possible duplicate entry at 4-RA-102-05. 
        Re-measured and got slightly different reading. Keeping both in data
        for transparency - will note in report.
        
15:30 - CML 4-RA-102-09 reading at 0.161" - this is alert threshold (t-min
        is 0.150"). Marked for 1-year reinspection. Notified Jennifer Walsh.

16:00 - End of shift. Critical finding paperwork completed with GLCP.

Daily Summary:
- CMLs Completed: 40 (+ 1 inaccessible documented)
- Lines Completed: 6-LA-103, 4-RA-101, 4-RA-102 (partial)
- CRITICAL: 4-RA-101-06 below t-min (0.142" vs 0.150")
- ALERT: 4-RA-102-09 approaching t-min (0.161")
- Inaccessible: 6-LA-103-08 (scaffold access issue)
- Weather delay in morning, made up time in afternoon


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 3 - Wednesday, November 6, 2024
Weather: Overcast, 45°F/33°F
Crew: M. Chen (Lead), S. Thompson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:00 - Site arrival. Jennifer Walsh met us to discuss yesterday's critical 
        finding. Engineering review in progress for 4-RA-101-06.
        
07:30 - Tailgate meeting. Extra focus on remaining Rich Amine lines due to
        findings from yesterday.

08:00 - Completing 4-RA-102 (remaining CMLs from yesterday).

09:00 - Started 6-RA-103 Rich Amine Header. This is main header feeding
        multiple branch lines.
        
10:30 - CML 6-RA-103-11 showing localized thin area: 0.168" vs t-min 0.180"
        Not quite critical but flagged for engineering review. Multiple
        circumferential readings taken to map thinning extent.
        
11:00 - Note from Marcus: One of my entries looks like I wrote "6-RA103-07"
        instead of "6-RA-103-07" (missing dash). Will correct in final data.
        
12:00 - LUNCH BREAK

13:00 - Started Regenerator Overhead lines (3-RV-101, 2-RV-102). These are
        high-temperature acid gas service - known to be aggressive.
        
14:00 - Several readings on 2-RV-102 showing accelerated corrosion rates
        compared to 2019 data. Multiple CMLs in "Monitor" category.
        
14:45 - CML 3-RV-101-04 showing 0.195" with calculated rate of 12 mpy. 
        This is higher than expected 5 mpy for this service. Flagged for
        process review - possible upset conditions?
        
15:15 - Sarah noticed she may have transposed digits on one reading for
        6-LA-103-05 earlier. Going back to verify tomorrow if time permits.

16:00 - End of shift.

Daily Summary:
- CMLs Completed: 41 (including spurious entry that needs cleanup)
- Lines Completed: 4-RA-102, 6-RA-103, 3-RV-101, 2-RV-102
- Alert: 6-RA-103-11 localized thin area (engineering review)
- Monitor: 3-RV-101-04 accelerated corrosion rate
- Several 2-RV-102 CMLs showing elevated rates
- Data entry issue identified (format inconsistency)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 4 - Thursday, November 7, 2024  
Weather: Clear, frost in AM, 43°F/30°F
Crew: M. Chen (Lead), S. Thompson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:00 - Arrived on site. Frost on grating - extra caution on elevated areas
        until sun melts it (~08:30).

07:30 - Tailgate meeting. Focus on completing remaining lines: Reflux lines,
        Steam line, and Cooling Water lines.
        
08:00 - Started Reflux lines (3-RF-101, 2-RF-102). These are 316SS material,
        using different velocity setting on gauge (0.2260 in/μs vs 0.2330 
        for carbon steel).
        
09:15 - Note: Sarah's entry for 3-RF-101-04 looks wrong - showing 1.87" which
        is impossible (nominal wall is only 0.216"). Likely decimal error,
        should be 0.187". Will correct in data.
        
10:00 - 2-RF-102 showing several readings below t-min. This line may need
        more attention from GLCP - flagging for report.

10:45 - Started Steam line 2-ST-101.

11:15 - CML 2-ST-101-03 is insulated. Requested insulation removal from GLCP
        but Robert Hendricks (Unit Engineer) declined - prefers to schedule
        full CUI inspection during next turnaround. Documented as inaccessible.
        
11:45 - Completed steam line. Started Cooling Water lines.

12:00 - LUNCH BREAK

13:00 - Continuing CW lines (3-CW-101, 3-CW-102).

13:30 - UNUSUAL FINDING on 3-CW-101: Several readings coming in HIGHER than
        nominal wall thickness (0.228", 0.231", 0.225" vs 0.216" nominal).
        This suggests internal deposit (scale buildup) rather than metal loss.
        Verified calibration - gauge is correct. Taking extra photos.
        Recommend internal inspection during next opportunity.

14:30 - Completed 3-CW-102. All CMLs done!

15:00 - Re-verified questionable reading from Day 3 (6-LA-103-05). Original
        reading stands - it was just unusual surface condition.
        
15:30 - Final walkdown of all areas. Cleanup of staging area. 
        Returned all GLCP-issued equipment (H2S monitors, radios).

16:00 - End of field work. Met with Jennifer Walsh for closeout discussion.
        Draft report to be delivered by November 14.

Daily Summary:
- CMLs Completed: 29
- Lines Completed: 3-RF-101, 2-RF-102, 2-ST-101, 3-CW-101, 3-CW-102
- CRITICAL findings on 2-RF-102 (below t-min)
- Inaccessible: 2-ST-101-03 (insulated, client declined removal)  
- Anomaly: 3-CW-101 showing scale buildup (readings > nominal)
- Data entry error identified (decimal place on 3-RF-101-04)
