The Three Paizanos: Percento, Fractionini and Decimalano
A Tale of Pizza, Numbers, and Family

You learned about percentages already—they're fantastic for quick comparisons, like "What percent of your class loves pineapple on pizza?" Last week, you learned about fractions, which come in real handy when sharing things, like splitting 1 pizza between 4 hungry kids.
And now it's time to learn about their clever cousin: Decimalano—but you can call him Decimal if you're not feeling fancy.
Percent (or percentage if you want to sound more like a grownup!), fractions, and decimals are all related; they're like cousins—Paizanos if you want to give it an Italian twist!
Let's say you wanted half of a pizza.
* You'd tell Percento: "I want 50% of a whole pizza."
* You'd tell Fractionini: "I want 1/2 of a whole pizza."
* You'd tell Decimalano: "I want 0.5 of a whole pizza."
Same pizza. Same amount. But each cousin understands it in their own favorite way!

The Paizano Pizza Math Trick
All three paizanos agree that:
* 1 whole pizza =
o 100%
o 1/1
o 1.0
And here's where it gets fun:
* 25% = 1/4 = 0.25
* 75% = 3/4 = 0.75
* 10% = 1/10 = 0.1
* 5% = 1/20 = 0.05
* 33% = about 1/3 = about 0.33 (and it keeps going: 0.3333…)
They all love slicing pizzas their own way. But don't mix up their languages!
If you tell Percento: "I want 0.5 pizza," he might drop his pepperoni in shock.
And if you tell Decimalano: "I want 1/4," he might say, "You mean 0.25, capisce?"

?? Common Mistakes That Even Grownups Make (Shh... Don't Tell)
Decimalano wants you to be careful of these pizza disasters:
1. Thinking 0.25 is more than 0.8.
? It's not! Even though "25" looks bigger than "8", we're talking about tenths and hundredths.
? Use your pizza brain: 0.25 is one-fourth of a pizza. 0.8 is almost the whole thing!
2. Forgetting the "point"!
0.5 is very different from 5.
o 0.5 pizzas is half a pizza.
o 5 pizzas is... a party! (And you better bring napkins.)
3. Confusing 0.1 with 0.10 or 0.100
?? Trick: Trailing zeros after the decimal don't change the value.
0.1 = 0.10 = 0.100 — all are the same, just dressed differently!
4. Not lining up the decimal when adding or subtracting.
?? Always line up your pizza slices—er, decimals—like good little toppings.

?? How to Convert Between the Cousins
Let's say you're looking at ¾ of a pizza:
* Fractionini says: "Easy! 3/4."
* Percento says: "That's 75%."
* Decimalano? "That's 0.75."
?? Think of it like a song:
Three-fourths, seventy-five percent, point seven five.
If you can hum it, you can remember it!

?? Decimalano's Place Value House
Here's how Decimal's house works:
Whole | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths
  1   | . |   2    |     5      |     0
This number is 1.250
* 1 whole pizza
* 2 tenths (2 big slices if pizza had 10 slices)
* 5 hundredths (5 small sprinkles if pizza had 100 crumbs!)
* 0 thousandths = nothing to see here... yet!

?? Practice Time: What Would You Tell Each Paizano?
Let's say you want three-tenths of a pizza.
* What do you say to Fractionini?
* What about Percento?
* And of course, Decimalano?
(Answers: 3/10, 30%, 0.3 — boom!)

?? In the End...
Even though Percento, Fractionini, and Decimalano speak different math languages, they're always making the same delicious pizza—just explaining it their own way. That's what makes them great paizanos.
So the next time someone asks, "How much pizza do you want?"
Tell them: "It depends… who's slicing?"
