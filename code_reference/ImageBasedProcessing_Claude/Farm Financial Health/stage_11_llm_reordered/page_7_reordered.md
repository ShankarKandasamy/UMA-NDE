Furthermore, a lack of available workers, and rising inflation rates, are resulting in an increasingly tight labour market, placing upward pressure on labour costs. Since the beginning of 2019 to August 2023, wages also increased from $20.29 to $23.42, further indicating a tight labour market (Statistics Canada, 2023).
