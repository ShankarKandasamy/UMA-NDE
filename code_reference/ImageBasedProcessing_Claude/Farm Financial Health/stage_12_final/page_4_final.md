# Recommendations for Action

Help manage the increased cost of production.

Recommendation #1: Extend the on-farm carbon pricing exemption for qualifying farming fuel to marketable natural gas and propane.

Recommendation #2: Consult on and develop a Critical Farm Input Strategy to ensure that Canadian producers have a long-term, stable source of supply for critical farm inputs, including fertilizer, needed to produce high quality agriculture and agri-food products.

Recommendation #3: Make the interest-free limit for advances under the Advance Payments Program (APP) permanent beyond the 2023 program, alongside other administrative program adjustments, to make the APP more accessible and responsive to higher production costs.

## Improve risk management programs and reduce regulatory and tax burdens that restrict competitiveness.

Recommendation #4: Make Accelerated Capital Cost Allowance permanent across all classes of farm equipment, allowing producers to depreciate 100% of their capital allocated to purchases of farm equipment in the first year.

Recommendation #5: Implement a new national grant program modelled after the Canada Digital Adoption Program that would support on-farm risk management planning and mitigation.

Recommendation #6: Improve resilience against extreme weather events for all agricultural commodities, including aquaculture, by ensuring business risk management programs are responsive, predictable, and accessible. An immediate example would be using Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Drought Monitor to trigger an AgriRecovery assessment.

Recommendation #7: Increase AgriStability program coverage to 85% of the reference margin to improve participation, predictability, and levels of support for producers.

Recommendation #8: Ensure that the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) is appropriately resourced and improves internal processes in support of timely, transparent, and science-based decisions that will help Canadian producers remain competitive in a global market.

Recommendation #9: Exempt farms from filing the Underused Housing Tax (UHT) return which requires private corporations and partnerships (including farms) that own residential property to file a UHT return, adding an unnecessary financial burden, even if they do not have to pay the tax.

Recommendation #10: Implement measures to support a farmer’s right to repair their farm machinery.

Recommendation #11: Build on the Budget 2023 extended interswitching pilot by further expanding the distance beyond 160km and extending the pilot past the current 18-month period.

Recommendation #12: Provide financial support for the creation of a Grocery Code Adjudication Office, which will be critical to advance the training, education, dispute resolution services, and oversight necessary to implement an industry-led Grocery Industry Code of Conduct.
