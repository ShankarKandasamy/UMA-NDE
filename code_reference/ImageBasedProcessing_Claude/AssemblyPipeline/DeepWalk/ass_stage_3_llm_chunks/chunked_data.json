These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DEEPWALK generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs: DEEPWALK uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DEEPWALK's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DEEPWALK outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information.",

Sparsity enables the design of efficient discrete algorithms, but can make it harder to generalize in statistical learning. Machine learning applications in networks (such as network classification, content recommendation, anomaly detection, and missing link prediction) must be able to deal with this sparsity in order to survive.\n\nIn this paper we introduce deep learning (unsupervised feature learning) techniques, which have proven successful in natural language processing, into network analysis for the first time. We develop an algorithm (DEEPWALK) that learns social representations of a graph's vertices by modeling a stream of short random walks.",

This results in a long tail of infrequent vertices; therefore, the updates that affect the model will be sparse in nature. This allows us to use an asynchronous version of stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) in the multi-worker case. Given that our updates are sparse and we do not acquire a lock to access the model's shared parameters, ASGD will achieve an optimal rate of convergence. While we run experiments on one machine using multiple threads, it has been demonstrated that this technique is highly scalable and can be used in very large-scale machine learning. Figure 4 presents the effects of parallelizing DEEPWALK, showing consistent speedup in processing BLOGCATALOG and FLICKR networks as we increase the number of workers to 8.",

In this variant, small walks from the graph are passed directly to the representation learning code, and the model is updated directly. Some modifications to the learning process will also be necessary: First, using a decaying learning rate will no longer be possible. Instead, we can initialize the learning rate to a small constant value. This will take longer to learn but may be worth it in some applications. Second, we cannot necessarily build a tree of parameters anymore.",

Vertices can be assigned to one of the remaining leaves when they are first seen. If we have the ability to estimate the vertex frequency a priori, we can also still use Huffman coding to decrease frequent element access times.\n\n### 4.4.2 Non-random walks\nSome graphs are created as a by-product of agents interacting with a sequence of elements (e.g., users' navigation of pages on a website). When a graph is created by such a stream of non-random walks, we can use this process to feed the modeling phase directly: Graphs sampled in this way will not only capture information related to network structure but also to the frequency at which paths are traversed.",

This approach can be combined with the streaming variant to train features on a continually evolving network without ever explicitly constructing the entire graph. Maintaining representations with this technique could enable web-scale classification without the hassles of dealing with a web-scale graph.\n\n# 5.

We repeat this process 10 times and report the average performance in terms of both Macro-F1 and Micro-F1.
