# Anatomy of the Somatosensory System

## Rapidly adapting

| Surface receptor / small receptive field | Hair receptor, Meissner's corpuscle: Detect an insect or a very fine vibration. Used for recognizing texture. |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Deep receptor / large receptive field     | Pacinian corpuscle: “A diffuse vibration” e.g. tapping with a pencil. |

## Slowly adapting

| Merkel's receptor: Used for spatial details, e.g. a round surface edge or “an X” in brail. | Ruffini's corpuscle: “A skin stretch”. Used for joint position in fingers. |

Table 1

Pain signals can be separated into individual components, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called second pain or burning pain; it is poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated with referred pain.

## Muscle Spindles

Scattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spindles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers, in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has
