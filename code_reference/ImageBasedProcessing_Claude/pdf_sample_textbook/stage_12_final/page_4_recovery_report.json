Arrows indicate excitatory connections; filled circles inhibitory connections.](attachment)\n\nMuscle spindles have few myofilaments and are non-contractile, but they do have one or more sensory endings applied to it. When the muscle is stretched, the central part of the intrafusal fiber is stretched and each sensory ending fires impulses. Muscle spindles also receive a motor innervation. The large motor neurons that supply extrafusal muscle fibers are called alpha motor neurons, while the smaller ones supplying the contractile portions of intrafusal fibers are called gamma neurons. Gamma motor neurons can regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle so that this sensitivity can be maintained at any given muscle length.\n\n## Joint Receptors\n\nThe joint receptors are low-threshold mechanoreceptors and have been divided into four groups. They signal different characteristics of joint function (position, movements, direction and speed of movements). The free receptors or type 4 joint receptors are nociceptors.\n\nFor more examples of how to use HTML and CSS for paper-based publishing; see css4.pub:\n\n4\n",
