The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well localized and easily tolerated. The much slower, highly affective component is called second pain or burning pain; it is poorly localized and poorly tolerated. The third or deep pain, arising from viscera, musculature and joints, is also poorly localized, can be chronic and is often associated with referred pain.\n\n> Notice how figure captions and sidenotes are shown in the outside margin (on the left or right; depending on whether the page is left or right): Also, figures are floated to the top/bottom of the page: Wide content, like the table and Figure 3, intrude into the outside margins:\n\n## Muscle Spindles\n\nScattered throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body are long, thin, stretch receptors called muscle spindles. They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers, in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so whenever the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched. The central region of each intrafusal fiber has only to intense mechanical stimuli, but also to heat and to noxious chemicals.
